: w RFC 4949将漏洞定义为“系统设计、实施或操作和管理中的缺陷或弱点，可被利用来违反系统的安全政策”SANS SEC560 |企业渗透测试和道德黑客作为渗透测试人员，我们的目标是利用安全漏洞，但什么是漏洞？RFC 4949将漏洞定义为：系统设计、实现或操作和管理中的缺陷或弱点，可被利用来违反系统的安全策略。简而言之，我们可以将其定义为可被威胁行为者利用的缺陷或弱点。大多数人将漏洞与内存损坏缺陷（例如缓冲区溢出）联系起来，但这只是所有安全漏洞的一部分。漏洞包括：•配置错误•设计和架构缺陷•审计功能缺失•密码弱/可猜测•默认凭据上述列表并非详尽无遗。上面没有列出许多其他类型的漏洞。Miter创建了常见弱点枚举，这是一个硬件和软件弱点类型列表。不要将其与CVE（常见漏洞和暴露）混淆，CVE列出了特定软件中的特定缺陷。

: A threat is an agent or actor that can cause harm. More broadly, it is anything that can cause harm. A threat could be the organized crime attacker attempting to stake credit card numbers, but it also could be the user who accidentally clicks the wrong button. A threat doesn't even have to be human. A worm is a threat, since the code is what is propagating and causing damage. Similarly, our own security tools can be considered a threat in certain contexts. A web application vulnerability scanner will crawl the website and submit data. If the scanner is pointed at a production website with production data, what would happen if the scanner "clicked" the delete button? Scanners will attempt to avoid sensitive actions, but things like these do happen. This is one of the reasons it is important to have backups and to have test systems.; 威胁是指可能造成伤害的代理人或行为者。更广泛地说，这是任何可能造成伤害的事情。一个威胁可能是有组织犯罪攻击者试图在信用卡号上下注，但也可能是用户意外点击了错误的按钮。威胁甚至不一定是人。蠕虫是一种威胁，因为代码是传播和造成损害的东西。同样，在某些情况下，我们自己的安全工具也可能被视为威胁。web应用程序漏洞扫描程序将对网站进行爬网并提交数据。如果扫描仪指向包含生产数据的生产网站，如果扫描仪“单击”删除按钮，会发生什么情况？扫描仪会试图避免敏感动作，但这样的事情确实会发生。这也是备份和测试系统很重要的原因之一

: An exploit is a code or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability. Here are a number of examples: •An exploit could take advantage of a vulnerably in memory management and allow the attacker to gain remote access to the system •An attacker could use an exploit and could use existing functionality to upload code and execute it, such as uploading a web shell to a web server using a feature that allows users to upload a resume or avatar •An attacker changes their name to JavaScript, exploiting the weak input filtering on the website •An attacker could run an executable that executed privileged operations on the system, thereby escalating access There are many different ways exploits can take advantage of vulnerabilities. In fact, the same vulnerability may be exploited differently by different threats depending on their end goal. We'll discuss exploits and exploit classes in more depth later in this course.; 漏洞攻击是利用漏洞的代码或技术。以下是一些示例：•漏洞利用可能利用易受攻击的内存管理，并允许攻击者远程访问系统•攻击者可以利用漏洞利用现有功能上载代码并执行代码，例如，使用允许用户上传简历或头像的功能将网页外壳上传到web服务器•攻击者将其名称更改为JavaScript，利用网站上的弱输入过滤•攻击者可以运行在系统上执行特权操作的可执行文件，因此，升级访问有许多不同的方式利用漏洞。事实上，同一漏洞可能会被不同的威胁以不同的方式利用，这取决于其最终目标。我们将在本课程后面更深入地讨论利用和利用类

: Risk is defined as the potential for loss or damage. Risk is often calculated as (Probability of Occurrence) * (Potential Impact). The potential impact is a number we can calculate with a reasonable degree of certainty; however, the likelihood is a much more contentious number. Often, the likelihood (and ultimately the risk value itself) comes down to the expert opinion of the security team. The team uses its collective knowledge and experience to determine the risk and ultimately provide guidance to the business. Balancing the risk with organizational needs is one of the fundamental goals of the security team. Unfortunately, many security teams are viewed as roadblocks—hindering the organization instead of enabling it develop and progress securely.
 As a penetration tester, part of your role is to estimate the risk related to the vulnerabilities you uncover. This is a powerful and important role. Junior testers will often overestimate the risk of vulnerabilities. Their reports will often be top heavy, where most of the risks are categorized as high or critical. As penetration testers mature, they learn to understand the risk and how it plays into the organizational processes. Understanding the risks, and identifying them, accordingly, helps the organization prioritize remediation efforts.; 风险定义为损失或损害的可能性。风险通常计算为（发生概率）*（潜在影响）。潜在影响是一个我们可以合理确定的数字；然而，可能性是一个更有争议的数字。通常，可能性（以及最终的风险值本身）取决于安全团队的专家意见。团队利用其集体知识和经验来确定风险，并最终为业务提供指导。平衡风险与组织需求是安全团队的基本目标之一。不幸的是，许多安全团队被视为阻碍组织发展的障碍，而不是使其能够安全地发展和进步。作为渗透测试人员，您的部分职责是估计与您发现的漏洞相关的风险。这是一个强大而重要的角色。初级测试人员通常会高估漏洞的风险。他们的报告通常是重中之重，其中大多数风险被归类为高风险或关键风险。随着渗透测试人员的成熟，他们学会了理解风险以及风险如何影响组织流程。了解风险并相应地识别它们，有助于组织确定补救工作的优先级

: We can simplify the risk by thinking about it as the intersection of the threat, vulnerability, and the risk. If we can reduce or eliminate one of these pieces, the risk is reduced or eliminated, respectively. We can limit access to the system, preventing a threat from accessing the service. Similarly, if the system no longer has sensitive data (PII, passwords, etc.), then there is no risk since it provides the attacker no value and no data can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.
 We can implement filtering tools to prevent an exploit from working. For example, we could use a WAF (web application firewall) to filter the characters of what would trigger the vulnerability. Similarly, an IPS could prevent specific actions against the target system that would trigger an exploit. In both cases, the vulnerability still exists, but it can't be exploited. Note: be careful with this approach as attackers will often change signatures or encoding to bypass these tools.
 Finally, we could remove the risk by patching the vulnerability.; 我们可以将风险简化为威胁、脆弱性和风险的交叉点。如果我们能够减少或消除其中一项，风险就会分别减少或消除。我们可以限制对系统的访问，防止威胁访问服务。类似地，如果系统不再具有敏感数据（PII、密码等），则没有风险，因为它不会为攻击者提供任何价值，也不会丢失、窃取或销毁任何数据。我们可以实现过滤工具来防止漏洞利用。例如，我们可以使用WAF（web应用程序防火墙）过滤触发漏洞的特征。类似地，IPS可以防止针对目标系统的特定操作触发漏洞攻击。在这两种情况下，漏洞仍然存在，但无法被利用。注意：使用这种方法时要小心，因为攻击者通常会更改签名或编码以绕过这些工具。最后，我们可以通过修补漏洞来消除风险

: There is another set of terms that many information security practitioners use interchangeably, which results in a lot of confusion. The following terms are associated with what an ethical hacker or penetration tester actually does on a day-to-day basis: •Penetration testing •Red Teaming •Vulnerability assessment (and security assessment) •Security audit Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they do have subtle distinctions that we should observe; 还有另一组术语，许多信息安全从业人员可以互换使用，这会导致很多混淆。以下术语与道德黑客或渗透测试人员的日常实际行为相关：•渗透测试•红队合作•漏洞评估（和安全评估）•安全审计虽然这些术语经常互换使用，但它们确实有细微的区别，我们应该观察到

: Penetration testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in a target that could allow an attacker to penetrate the computer or network and steal, damage, or corrupt data. Penetration testers (pen testers) will use tools similar to the malicious attackers. Sometimes, the malicious actors even take tools and techniques from penetration testers.
 As the name implies, penetration testing requires penetration (if possible). A test that forbids penetration is not a penetration test. Sometimes targets ask for a penetration test, but then disallow exploitation, password guessing, and other activities that would allow the testers to verify flaws and find second order vulnerabilities. These handcuffed tests are more akin to vulnerability assessments.; 渗透测试的重点是识别目标中的漏洞，使攻击者能够渗透计算机或网络并窃取、损坏或破坏数据。渗透测试人员（pen测试人员）将使用类似于恶意攻击者的工具。有时，恶意参与者甚至从渗透测试人员那里获取工具和技术。顾名思义，渗透测试需要渗透（如果可能）。禁止渗透的测试不是渗透测试。有时，目标要求进行渗透测试，但不允许利用、密码猜测和其他活动，这些活动将允许测试人员验证缺陷并发现二阶漏洞。这些手铐测试更类似于漏洞评估

: Red Teams are focused on testing the effectiveness of the entire security program. They emulate the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of real-world adversaries with the goal of measuring weaknesses in defense, detection, and response. Red Teams use many of the same tools as penetration testers; however, they have a different focus. The Red Team is focused on identifying deficiencies in the Blue Team's (defenders) ability to detect, respond, and eradicate a threat. A Red Team only uses vulnerabilities that help them accomplish their goal, while penetration testers are most often tasked with finding many vulnerabilities.
 Penetration testing is focused on finding flaws, understanding their business risks, and helping the organization to improve its security stance. The Red Team's primary job is to help make the Blue Team better equipped to detect and respond to attacks. To put it simply, penetration testing focuses on the defenses (technology) and Red Team focuses on the defenders (people).; 红队专注于测试整个安全计划的有效性。他们模拟真实世界对手的战术、技术和程序（TTP），目的是测量防御、检测和响应中的弱点。红队使用许多与渗透测试相同的工具；然而，他们有不同的重点。红队专注于发现蓝队（防守队员）在发现、应对和消除威胁方面的不足。红队只使用帮助他们实现目标的漏洞，而渗透测试人员的任务通常是查找许多漏洞。渗透测试的重点是发现缺陷，了解其业务风险，并帮助组织改进其安全立场。红队的主要工作是帮助蓝队更好地检测和应对攻击。简单来说，渗透测试侧重于防御（技术），而红队侧重于防守（人员）

: Purple Teams are cross-functional teams where the Red and Blue Teams work together. The closer the interaction, the better. This type of assessment includes metrics on Blue’s ability to identify, detect, and respond to an attack. The key components can be summarized with "ACE": •Automation: How automated and timely is the detection and notification workflow? •Coverage: Across how much of the environment will this detection work? Is it limited to specific systems or subnets? •Effectiveness: How effective is the detection? Is there a high false positive rate? Does the detection only work in specific circumstances? The testing should be documented to show advances in detection and response capabilities. These metrics can be used to justify investments in tools and training.
 Additional reading on the Purple Team: redsiege.com/purple; 紫色团队是跨职能团队，红色团队和蓝色团队一起工作。互动越紧密越好。此类评估包括Blue识别、检测和响应攻击的能力指标。关键组件可以用“ACE”来概括：•自动化：检测和通知工作流的自动化程度和及时性如何覆盖范围：这种检测在多大程度上可以在环境中工作？它是否仅限于特定系统或子网有效性：检测的有效性如何？假阳性率高吗？检测是否仅在特定情况下有效？测试应记录在案，以显示检测和响应能力的进步。这些指标可用于证明对工具和培训的投资。关于紫色团队的补充阅读：redseake.com/Purple

: Finally, we have the phrase security audit. An audit implies that we are measuring things against a fixed, predetermined, rigorous set of standards. These audits are almost always done with detailed checklists.
 Some penetration testing and ethical hacking organizations have created their own internal checklists of items that need to be covered in a test, but these checklists aren't as detailed as those for comprehensive audits.
 Our focus in this class is not on auditing. SANS has numerous other classes that address security audits in detail.
 Our focus is on ethical hacking and penetration testing.; 最后，我们有一个短语“安全审计”。审计意味着我们是根据一套固定的、预先确定的、严格的标准来衡量事物的。这些审计几乎总是通过详细的检查表来完成。一些渗透测试和道德黑客组织已经创建了自己的内部检查表，列出了测试中需要涵盖的项目，但这些检查表没有全面审计的检查表详细。我们这节课的重点不是审计。SAN还有许多其他类详细处理安全审计。我们的重点是道德黑客和渗透测试

: Many people use the phrases vulnerability assessments and security assessments to describe the work done by penetration testers and ethical hackers, but there is a subtle distinction between a penetration test and a security assessment.
 A penetration test is focused on getting in or stealing data. The emphasis is on penetrating the target environment by exploiting discovered vulnerabilities.
 Vulnerability assessments and security assessments are focused on finding vulnerabilities, often without regard to actually exploiting them and getting in.
 Thus, penetration testing often goes deeper, with its goal of taking over systems and stealing data, whereas security and vulnerability assessments are broader, involving the process of looking for security flaws. These assessments also often include policy and procedure reviews, which are usually not included in penetration testing.; 许多人使用漏洞评估和安全评估这两个短语来描述渗透测试人员和道德黑客所做的工作，但渗透测试和安全评估之间有着微妙的区别。渗透测试的重点是获取或窃取数据。重点是通过利用发现的漏洞渗透目标环境。漏洞评估和安全评估的重点是发现漏洞，通常不考虑实际利用漏洞并介入。因此，渗透测试通常更深入，其目标是接管系统和窃取数据，而安全和漏洞评估更广泛，涉及寻找安全漏洞的过程。这些评估通常还包括政策和程序审查，这通常不包括在渗透测试中

: A formal definition of penetration testing is as follows: Penetration testing involves modeling the techniques used by real-world computer attackers to find vulnerabilities, and, under controlled circumstances, to exploit those flaws in a professional, safe manner according to a carefully designed scope and Rules of Engagement to determine business risk and potential impact, all with the goal of helping the organization improve security practices.
 The key is that the vulnerability identification and exploitation should always be business focused. The penetration test findings should always focus on the organizational risk, not just the technical risk.
 Many organizations use ethical hacking and penetration testing to find security flaws before the bad guys do.
 After applying their security policies, procedures, and technology, organizations can use thorough penetration tests to see how effective their security is in light of an actual attack, albeit by friendly attackers.
 An added benefit of ethical hacking and penetration testing is that because they show real vulnerabilities and indicate what a malicious attacker might be capable of achieving, they can get management's attention. Decision makers, when presented with the carefully formulated results of a test in business terms, are more likely to provide resources and attention to improve the security stance of an organization; 渗透测试的正式定义如下：渗透测试涉及对真实世界的计算机攻击者使用的技术进行建模，以发现漏洞，并在受控情况下，根据精心设计的范围和参与规则，以专业、安全的方式利用这些漏洞，以确定业务风险和潜在影响，所有这些都是为了帮助组织改进安全实践。关键是漏洞识别和利用应始终以业务为中心。渗透测试结果应始终关注组织风险，而不仅仅是技术风险。许多组织使用道德黑客和渗透测试在坏人之前发现安全漏洞。在应用其安全策略、程序和技术后，组织可以使用彻底的渗透测试来查看其安全性在实际攻击中的有效性，尽管是由友好的攻击者发起的。道德黑客和渗透测试的另一个好处是，由于它们显示了真实的漏洞，并指示恶意攻击者可能会实现的目标，因此可以引起管理层的注意。当决策者从商业角度看到精心制定的测试结果时，他们更有可能提供资源和注意力来改善组织的安全状况

: There are numerous kinds of penetration tests: •Network services test: This is one of the most common types of tests and involves finding target systems on the network, looking for openings in their underlying operating systems and available network services, and then exploiting them remotely. Some of these network service tests happen remotely across the internet, targeting the organization's perimeter networks. Others are launched locally from the target's own facilities to evaluate the security of the internal network or the DMZ from within, seeing what kinds of vulnerabilities an internal user could discover.
 •Assumed breach test: This kind of test is designed to find vulnerabilities in the network once an attacker has gained access to a system in the network. This is a fantastic way to find issues in Active Directory permissions, file permissions (excessive sharing on file-shares), and client-side software.
 •Web application test: These tests look for security vulnerabilities in the web-based applications deployed in the target environment.
 •Social engineering test: This type of test involves attempting to dupe a user into revealing sensitive information, such as a password, or possibly convincing a user to click a link in an email. These tests are often conducted via email or over the phone, targeting selected help desks or users and evaluating processes, procedures, and user awareness.
 •Wireless security test: These tests involve exploring a target's physical environment to find unauthorized wireless access points or authorized wireless access points with security weaknesses.
 •Remote dial-up war dial test: These tests look for modems in a target environment and often involve password guessing to log in to systems connected to discovered modems. Currently, they are not common.; 渗透测试有很多种：•网络服务测试：这是最常见的测试类型之一，涉及在网络上查找目标系统，寻找其底层操作系统和可用网络服务中的漏洞，然后远程利用它们。其中一些网络服务测试通过互联网远程进行，目标是组织的外围网络。另一些是从目标公司自己的设施本地启动的，以从内部评估内部网络或DMZ的安全性，查看内部用户可以发现哪些类型的漏洞假设破坏测试：这种测试旨在一旦攻击者获得对网络中系统的访问权限，就发现网络中的漏洞。这是一种发现Active Directory权限、文件权限（文件共享上的过度共享）和客户端软件问题的绝佳方法Web应用程序测试：这些测试寻找目标环境中部署的基于Web的应用程序中的安全漏洞社会工程学测试：这类测试涉及试图欺骗用户泄露敏感信息，例如密码，或者可能说服用户单击电子邮件中的链接。这些测试通常通过电子邮件或电话进行，针对选定的服务台或用户，并评估流程、程序和用户意识无线安全测试：这些测试涉及探索目标的物理环境，以找到未经授权的无线接入点或具有安全弱点的授权无线接入点远程拨号战争拨号测试：这些测试在目标环境中查找调制解调器，通常涉及密码猜测，以登录到与发现的调制解调器连接的系统。目前，它们并不常见。

: •Physical security test: This test looks for flaws in the physical security practices of a target organization.
 Testers might attempt to gain access to buildings and rooms or to take laptops, desktops, or recycling bins out of target facilities. A dumpster diving test is a variation of a physical security analysis. Physical testing must be conducted carefully to ensure that the testers do not get hurt or arrested during their work.
 •Product security test: This test focuses on one specific product. It could be a hardware or software. In this kind of test, you look for security flaws in products that can be used in the tester’s laboratory systems.
 Such tests look for flaws in the software, such as exploitable buffer overflow conditions, privilege escalation flaws, and the exposure of unencrypted sensitive data. These tests could focus on bypassing or breaking the encryption of data stored on a local system or across the network. Some of these tests also evaluate the strength of digital rights management (DRM) solutions. Due to legal restrictions regarding reverse engineering copyright protections (such as those imposed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States), any contract regarding the analysis of DRM software should be inspected by a lawyer to ensure that the proper permission has been derived from the owners of the given DRM solution.; 物理安全测试：该测试查找目标组织的物理安全实践中的缺陷。测试人员可能试图进入建筑物和房间，或者从目标设施中取出笔记本电脑、台式电脑或回收箱。垃圾箱潜水测试是物理安全分析的一种变体。必须仔细进行物理测试，以确保测试人员在工作期间不会受伤或被捕产品安全测试：该测试侧重于一个特定的产品。它可以是硬件或软件。在这种测试中，您需要查找可用于测试人员实验室系统的产品中的安全缺陷。此类测试寻找软件中的缺陷，例如可利用的缓冲区溢出条件、权限提升缺陷和未加密敏感数据的暴露。这些测试可能侧重于绕过或破坏存储在本地系统或网络上的数据加密。其中一些测试还评估了数字版权管理（DRM）解决方案的强度。由于有关反向工程版权保护的法律限制（例如美国《数字千年版权法》施加的限制），任何与DRM软件分析有关的合同都应该由律师检查，以确保已获得给定DRM解决方案所有者的适当许可

: Both malicious attackers and professional penetration testers/ethical hackers apply various phases in their attacks.
 Attacks are often separated into these phases: •Reconnaissance is the process of investigating the target organization to gather information about it from publicly available sources, such as domain registration services, websites, and so on. Some people include techniques such as social engineering and dumpster diving in the recon phase.
 •Scanning is the process of finding openings in the target organization, such as internet gateways, available systems, listening ports, and vulnerability lists.
 •In the Exploitation phase, attackers exploit target systems to compromise them, possibly getting control of them, or causing a denial-of-service attack.
 •Post-exploitation is what happens after the initial compromise. Both penetration testers and malicious attackers use their access to pivot and move throughout the target environment.
 Although legitimate tests often include the previously listed phases, malicious attackers often go further than the Rules of Engagement allow for a professional penetration test. The next phase, often used by a malicious attacker to maintain access to and control of a target machine, involves setting up the compromised machine so that the attacker can keep control over it, with techniques such as installing backdoors and planting rootkits. Malicious attackers also often use a final phase, Covering the Tracks, in which they employ log editing, file hiding, and covert channels to hide their activities on a system.
 Please note that the best of the attackers (both the good guys and the evil ones) are pragmatists. They don't always proceed from reconnaissance to scanning to gaining access and so on. Sure, they use these steps, but they are likely to jump around among them as events and discoveries warrant. For example, during the recon phase, attackers may discover an exploitable flaw that they will use to gain access directly, temporarily bypassing scanning. Then, after they gain access to one machine, they may go back and start scanning.
 From a professional testing perspective, though, be careful when jumping out of order among these steps, making sure that you return to the earlier phases to conduct a comprehensive test.; 恶意攻击者和专业渗透测试人员/道德黑客在其攻击中应用不同阶段。攻击通常分为以下几个阶段：•侦察是调查目标组织的过程，以从公开来源（如域名注册服务、网站等）收集有关信息。有些人在侦察阶段使用社交工程和垃圾桶潜水等技术扫描是在目标组织中查找漏洞的过程，例如互联网网关、可用系统、侦听端口和漏洞列表在攻击阶段，攻击者利用目标系统对其进行攻击，可能获得对其的控制，或造成拒绝服务攻击后剥削是在最初的妥协之后发生的事情。渗透测试人员和恶意攻击者都使用其访问权限在整个目标环境中旋转和移动。虽然合法测试通常包括前面列出的阶段，但恶意攻击者通常会超出专业渗透测试的参与规则。下一个阶段通常被恶意攻击者用来维护对目标机器的访问和控制，包括设置受损机器，以便攻击者可以通过安装后门和植入rootkit等技术对其进行控制。恶意攻击者还经常使用最后阶段，覆盖轨迹，在该阶段中，他们使用日志编辑、文件隐藏和隐蔽通道来隐藏其在系统上的活动。请注意，最好的攻击者（好人和坏人）都是实用主义者。他们并不总是从侦察到扫描再到获取访问权限等等。当然，他们会使用这些步骤，但当事件和发现需要时，他们很可能会在这些步骤之间跳跃。例如，在侦察阶段，攻击者可能会发现一个可利用的漏洞，他们将使用该漏洞直接获得访问权限，暂时绕过扫描。然后，在他们访问一台机器后，他们可以返回并开始扫描。但是，从专业测试的角度来看，在这些步骤中跳出顺序时要小心，确保返回到早期阶段进行全面测试

: Linux or Windows?" When confronted with this question, we recommend that your pen test toolset include both operating systems side by side, working together to maximize your efficiency and capabilities. The truth is that some tools work better on Linux, whereas others work better on Windows. Some tools work just fine on both, whereas other tools have been released for only one of those platforms. Thus, if you choose to work in only one OS or at least just focus on that OS, you'll be missing out on a lot of useful tools and techniques. To improve productivity and streamline workflow, we recommend virtualizing one of these two OSs, perhaps using VMware, and running the two simultaneously on the same hardware so that you can quickly switch between them.
 The entire question posed at the start of the preceding paragraph illustrates a mindset that should be transcended.
 Don't think of them as two different operating systems. Think of them as one set of tools that you use in your penetration testing and ethical hacking job. As a carpenter or plumber would use the best tool that is available and convenient for a given job, so should you. To continue with that analogy, don't think of Windows and Linux as two different toolboxes. Instead, they are two different compartments in your single toolbox.
 Some of you are no doubt wondering whether macOS is an acceptable platform for penetration testing and ethical hacking. It is—with remarkable stability and ease of use. However, there are some tools for Linux and Windows that simply will not run on macOS, no matter how hard you try to get them installed. Thus, if you plan to use macOS, make sure you get a virtualization solution for it (such as VMware Fusion or Parallels) so that you can also run both Windows and Linux on top of macOS.; Linux还是Windows？“当遇到这个问题时，我们建议您的笔测试工具集同时包含两个操作系统，共同工作以最大限度地提高效率和能力。事实是，一些工具在Linux上工作得更好，而另一些工具在Windows上工作得更好。一些工具在两个平台上都工作得很好，而其他工具仅针对其中一个平台发布。因此，如果您选择如果你只在一个操作系统中工作，或者至少只专注于那个操作系统，你就会错过很多有用的工具和技术。为了提高生产效率和简化工作流程，我们建议虚拟化这两个操作系统中的一个，可能使用VMware，并在同一硬件上同时运行这两个，以便您可以在它们之间快速切换。上一段开头提出的整个问题说明了一种应该超越的心态。不要将它们视为两个不同的操作系统。可以将其视为渗透测试和道德黑客工作中使用的一套工具。作为一个木匠或水管工会使用最好的工具，是可用的，并为给定的工作方便，所以你应该。为了继续这个类比，不要将Windows和Linux视为两个不同的工具箱。相反，它们是单个工具箱中的两个不同隔间。你们中的一些人无疑想知道macOS是否是一个可接受的渗透测试和道德黑客平台。它具有显著的稳定性和易用性。然而，有些Linux和Windows工具根本无法在macOS上运行，无论你多么努力地安装它们。因此，如果您计划使用macOS，请确保为其提供虚拟化解决方案（如VMware Fusion或Parallels），以便您也可以在macOS上运行Windows和Linux

: For the remainder of this class, we need to carefully differentiate between the machines used by the penetration tester or ethical hacker and the machines whose security is being evaluated.
 We use the terminology testing machines and attack machines to refer to the systems that the tester uses to evaluate the security of other systems. These testing machines often run the attacker's scanning and exploitation tools. In figures, these machines will be represented with a red screen and with the attacker inside. We use these pictorial clues to help you rapidly identify where the attacker's machines are in a diagram. However, please do not think that the black hat on this computer implies that the attacker is somehow evil. The attackers we refer to here are professional ethical hackers and penetration testers. The black hat just makes this system easier to quickly locate in the figure.
 The machines whose security is being evaluated are referred to as target machines and, occasionally, as victim machines. They are represented pictorially as a standard machine, with no hat.; 对于本课程的其余部分，我们需要仔细区分渗透测试人员或道德黑客使用的机器和正在评估其安全性的机器。我们使用术语测试机和攻击机来指代测试人员用于评估其他系统安全性的系统。这些测试机通常运行攻击者的扫描和利用工具。在图中，这些机器将用红色屏幕表示，攻击者在其中。我们使用这些图片线索来帮助您快速识别攻击者的机器在图中的位置。然而，请不要认为这台计算机上的黑帽子意味着攻击者是邪恶的。我们这里提到的攻击者是职业道德黑客和渗透测试人员。黑帽子只是让这个系统更容易在图中快速定位。正在评估其安全性的机器被称为目标机器，有时也被称为受害者机器。它们以图形表示为标准机器，没有帽子

: As we've seen, your tests might rely on free, commercial, and/or in-house tools, depending on the policies of your organization. Whichever tools you use, you should test them in a laboratory environment to make sure you understand how they work and their potential impacts on a target machine. Such laboratory testing and analysis is especially vital for free tools downloaded from the internet because of concerns about quality, the potential to crash a target, and hidden functionality that could compromise the test systems.
 It is important to have a good lab that consists of many of the same systems and software you will see in the target environment. Obviously, the lab can’t contain all possible combinations or all software, but a representative sampling is good for my purposes. We'll discuss this more shortly.
 Often, Red Teams will run their commands in their lab before the commands are used in the target environment.
 This ensures the Red Team has the correct syntax and outcomes so as to reduce the number of artifacts on the target. If the Red Team executes the wrong command or has a typo, the Red Team will need to run another command, thereby leaving additional artifacts and increasing the likelihood of being caught.
 Virtual machines are a great way for offensive personnel to quickly build, test, revert, and clone test systems. The VMs can be run on old hardware, or even the testers laptop. Jeff McJunkin has a webcast on "Building Your Own Super Duper Home Lab" located at: youtube.com/watch?v=uzqwoufhwvk Short link:redsiege.com/560/lab; 正如我们所看到的，您的测试可能依赖于免费、商业和/或内部工具，这取决于您组织的策略。无论使用哪种工具，都应该在实验室环境中对其进行测试，以确保了解其工作方式及其对目标机器的潜在影响。这种实验室测试和分析对于从互联网下载的免费工具尤其重要，因为担心质量、目标崩溃的可能性以及可能危及测试系统的隐藏功能。重要的是要有一个好的实验室，由许多与目标环境中相同的系统和软件组成。显然，实验室不能包含所有可能的组合或所有软件，但代表性采样对我来说很好。我们稍后将对此进行讨论。通常情况下，红色团队在将命令用于目标环境之前，会在实验室中运行命令。这确保了红色团队具有正确的语法和结果，从而减少目标上的工件数量。如果红队执行了错误的命令或输入了错别字，红队将需要运行另一个命令，从而留下额外的工件并增加被抓到的可能性。虚拟机是攻击性人员快速构建、测试、恢复和克隆测试系统的好方法。虚拟机可以在旧硬件上运行，甚至可以在测试人员的笔记本电脑上运行。Jeff McJunkin在youtube上有一个关于“建立自己的超级Duper家庭实验室”的网络广播。通信/观看？v=uzqwoufhwvk短链接：redsize.com/560/lab

: As previously mentioned, it is important that we have systems that resemble a wide range of target networks.
 Most networks use a Windows Domain and, therefore, a Domain Controller (we'll discuss attacking the Windows Domain later in this course). Similarly, most of these networks include Windows file servers and web servers.
 You could combine these two roles into one system to save on physical resources and licensing. Of course, the most widely used end-user system in the enterprise is Windows, so we'll need one of those systems in our lab.
 Unfortunately, using Windows in a lab is more difficult due to licensing. Of course, you can pay for licenses and can have as many different targets as you like, including older server and end-user systems. Many people have much tighter budgetary constraints that limit them to free systems only. We do not recommend or condone stealing or otherwise bypassing the legal licensing requirements set by Microsoft (or other vendors). Microsoft does offer free virtual machines for testing; however, it is limited to the latest operating system, and the licensing window is limited.
 On the Linux side, we can use a range of free Linux systems. For example, Ubuntu is a common free Linux distribution found in enterprises. While most of the installs and updates for Linux are free, some are not. For example, Red Had updates are not free, but it is very similar to CentOS and Fedora. For more details on this relationship between Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS, you can read more here: https://danielmiessler.com/studv/fedora redhat centos/ Short Link:redsiege.com/560/centos; 如前所述，重要的是我们的系统类似于广泛的目标网络。大多数网络使用Windows域，因此使用域控制器（我们将在本课程后面讨论攻击Windows域）。类似地，这些网络大多包括Windows文件服务器和web服务器。您可以将这两个角色合并到一个系统中，以节省物理资源和许可。当然，企业中使用最广泛的最终用户系统是Windows，因此我们的实验室需要一个这样的系统。不幸的是，由于许可，在实验室中使用Windows更加困难。当然，您可以支付许可证费用，并可以拥有任意多个不同的目标，包括较旧的服务器和最终用户系统。许多人有更严格的预算限制，仅限于自由系统。我们不建议或纵容盗窃或以其他方式绕过微软（或其他供应商）设定的合法许可要求。微软确实提供免费的虚拟机进行测试；但是，它仅限于最新的操作系统，并且许可窗口有限。在Linux方面，我们可以使用一系列免费的Linux系统。例如，Ubuntu是企业中常见的免费Linux发行版。虽然Linux的大多数安装和更新都是免费的，但有些不是。例如，Red Had更新不是免费的，但它与CentOS和Fedora非常相似。有关Fedora、Red Hat和CentOS之间关系的更多详细信息，您可以在此处阅读：https://danielmiessler.com/studv/fedoraredhat centos/Short链接：redseake.com/560/centos

: dedicated to testing and are unique for each engagement.
 •Disabled defenses: The attack systems will not have defensive software such as AV/EDR, and it will often have its firewall disabled. These modifications decrease the defensive strength of the system should it come under attack from an adversary. You don't want these features disabled on your day-to-day system.
 •Uptime: The testing systems will often need to be available and online for weeks or months. If you were to run the attack from your laptop (or even a VM on your laptop), the test could be impacted if you carry your laptop to another location (network change) or perform your day-to-day tasks (installing software, rebooting, patching).
 •Prevent data leakage: If you use unique systems for each test, it is less likely that the data from one test will end up in the data from another test. This is especially important for third-party testers where the test data is likely to be from different organizations where such an action could be considered a breach of confidentiality. Such a cross-contamination could lead to embarrassment, loss of trust, and even legal action.
 At the conclusion of a test, be sure to clean the target data from the test systems. You can't lose data you don't have.; 专注于测试，每项服务都是独一无二的禁用防御：攻击系统将不具有AV/EDR等防御软件，并且通常会禁用其防火墙。如果系统受到敌人的攻击，这些修改会降低系统的防御强度。您不希望在日常系统中禁用这些功能正常运行时间：测试系统通常需要数周或数月的可用性和在线性。如果您要从笔记本电脑（甚至是笔记本电脑上的虚拟机）运行攻击，如果您将笔记本电脑带到其他位置（网络更改）或执行日常任务（安装软件、重新启动、修补），测试可能会受到影响防止数据泄漏：如果您为每个测试使用唯一的系统，则一个测试的数据最终出现在另一个测试数据中的可能性较小。这对于第三方测试人员来说尤其重要，因为测试数据可能来自不同的组织，在这些组织中，这样的行为可能被视为违反机密。这种交叉污染可能导致尴尬、失去信任，甚至法律诉讼。在测试结束时，确保从测试系统中清除目标数据。你不能丢失你没有的数据

: Next, we need the actual systems that will be used for the testing. The needs for internal testing and external testing are different.
 For internal testing, we can use a "leave behind" or "drop box" for long-running tasks. We can also use this for remote-internal or pseudo-internal testing, which allows the penetration testers to work remotely but have internal access to their desired testing systems. The drop box could be physical, such as a laptop or a minicomputer. If you use full disk encryption (FDE) on the system, the target will then have to unlock the disc when initially booted or on reboot. Alternatively, the host OS could be booted without a key and then the sensitive client data could be stored in an encrypted container using a key known to the pen testers. If there is any unencrypted data on the system, ensure it is properly scrubbed before shipping. You never want to ship unencrypted sensitive target data through the mail or a public shipping company. If that system is lost, it could be considered a reportable breach.
 To get around the shipping issue, some third-party testers will sell or expense the drop box to the client as part of the contract. This also solves another common issue: internal access. Some organizations have strict policies as to what systems are allowed on the network. Corporate assets are allowed on the network, but third-party owned assets require extra verification, documentation, and paperwork. If the organization owns the physical drop box device, then it is often easier to get the device on the network.
 You could create a custom VM configured to connect back to the pen testers and no shipping is ever required.
 However, this often requires extra action from the internal team to provision, setup, and configure the VM.
 There are third-party, remote, access-as-a-service companies who deal with the shipping logistics and work with the client to get the device connected. For example, Telesploit ships a NUC-based mini PC with a clean, preinstalled copy of Kali. Once configured, the penetration testers can connect to the internal network via the Telesploit system. Telesploit offers a fully managed service where they take care of configuration, shipping, licensing, and customer support. They also offer a partially managed system that you can rent or buy. Their software is open source if you choose to configure it yourself.

: Next, we need the actual systems that will be used for the testing. The needs for internal testing and external testing are different.
 Internal Testing For internal testing, we can use a "leave behind" or "drop box" for long-running tasks. We can all use this to allow remote-internal testing, which allows the penetration testers to work remotely but have internal access to their desired testing systems. The drop box could be physical, such as a laptop or a minicomputer. If it is a physical device, make sure you encrypt or wipe data from the device before it is returned from the target. Alternatively, you could create a custom VM configured to connect back to the penetration testers.
 External Testing For external testing, we have two options: cloud infrastructure or self-hosted. Cloud infrastructure is much more common due to the ease of creating and destroying the test systems. Cloud has the additional benefit of allowing the penetration testers to use setup testing infrastructure all over the world and change IP addresses/subnets.
 Alternatively, you could self-host the testing infrastructure, either in your datacenter or a co-location facility. If you host your own systems, it can be more difficult to perform a full cleanup of the testing system. The benefit of self-hosting is that the IP address is not associated with any cloud service provider. Some advanced defenders perform additional monitoring on traffic to cloud providers due to its heavy usage by attackers for command and control.; 接下来，我们需要用于测试的实际系统。内部测试和外部测试的需求不同。内部测试对于内部测试，我们可以使用“遗留”或“下拉框”来执行长期运行的任务。我们都可以使用它来进行远程内部测试，这允许渗透测试人员远程工作，但可以在内部访问他们想要的测试系统。投递箱可以是物理的，例如笔记本电脑或小型计算机。如果是物理设备，请确保在从目标返回数据之前加密或擦除设备中的数据。或者，您可以创建一个配置为连接回渗透测试仪的自定义虚拟机。外部测试对于外部测试，我们有两种选择：云基础设施或自托管。由于易于创建和销毁测试系统，云基础设施更加常见。云的另一个好处是允许渗透测试人员在世界各地使用设置测试基础设施，并更改IP地址/子网。或者，您可以在您的数据中心或同一位置设施中自托管测试基础设施。如果您托管自己的系统，则执行测试系统的完整清理可能会更加困难。自托管的好处是，IP地址与任何云服务提供商都没有关联。由于攻击者大量使用云服务进行命令和控制，一些高级防御者对云服务提供商的流量进行额外监控

: systems in two different ways: as sources of network-based attacks and as computing farms for password cracking attacks. Regardless of how you use cloud-based resources in your penetration tests, make sure that your use is allowed under the cloud service providers' terms of use. Otherwise, you could be in breach of contract, suffer from a lawsuit, or even face a criminal investigation.
 Using cloud-based systems as a source of attacks, penetration testers can launch scanning, exploitation, and postexploitation activities from virtual systems located in the cloud. This could benefit the penetration testers from a cost perspective, running large-scale scans from essentially rented systems for less than US$1 per hour. In addition, it opens up other benefits. Many target organizations will be far more likely to allow inbound access from addresses owned by a cloud service provider. This is especially true if the given target organization hosts resources in that same cloud. Such organizations likely won't (or can't) then filter attacks coming from that cloud's IP address space.
 There are many different cloud providers that allow penetration testing (source), including Digital Ocean, Amazon, Azure, and Linode. Be sure to read the terms of service so you don't violate the agreement and have your systems shutdown or destroyed (or worse, a lawsuit).
 Alternatively, some penetration testers use cloud instances to crack passwords. Amazon's EC2 instances offer an option of GPU support. The Coalfire team has released the free NPK tool that allows you to easily build and manage your own cloud cracking infrastructure and not be burned by the price. From the NPK documentation: NPK lets you leverage extremely powerful hash cracking with the 'pay-as-you-go' benefits of AWS. For example, you can crank out as much as 1.2TH/s of NTLM for a mere $14.70/hr. NPK was also designed to fit easily within the free tier while you're not using it! Without the free tier, it'll still cost less than 25 CENTS per MONTH to have online! https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog/March-2019/High-Power-Hash-Cracking-with-NPK Short link:redsiege.com/560/npk; 许多渗透测试人员依赖基于云的资源作为攻击平台。他们通常以两种不同的方式依赖此类系统：作为基于网络的攻击源和密码破解攻击的计算场。无论您在渗透测试中如何使用基于云的资源，请确保您的使用符合云服务提供商的使用条款。否则，你可能会违反合同，遭受诉讼，甚至面临刑事调查。使用基于云的系统作为攻击源，渗透测试人员可以从云中的虚拟系统启动扫描、利用和利用后活动。从成本角度来看，这可能使渗透测试人员受益，从基本租用的系统上运行大规模扫描，每小时不到1美元。此外，它还带来了其他好处。许多目标组织更可能允许从云服务提供商拥有的地址进行入站访问。如果给定的目标组织在同一个云中托管资源，则尤其如此。这样的组织可能不会（或不能）过滤来自该云IP地址空间的攻击。有许多不同的云提供商允许渗透测试（源），包括Digital Ocean、Amazon、Azure和Linode。一定要阅读服务条款，这样你就不会违反协议，让你的系统关机或被破坏（或者更糟的是，被起诉）。或者，一些渗透测试人员使用云实例破解密码。Amazon的EC2实例提供了GPU支持选项。Coalfire团队发布了免费的NPK工具，可以让你轻松构建和管理自己的云破解基础设施，而不会被价格所吞噬。从NPK文档中可以看出：NPK允许您利用AWS的“现收现付”优势，利用极其强大的哈希破解。例如，仅需14.70美元/小时，您就可以实现高达1.2TH/s的NTLM。NPK也被设计成在你不使用它的时候可以很容易地适应免费层！如果没有免费层，每月上网的费用仍然不到25美分！https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog/March-2019/High-Power-Hash-Cracking-with-NPK短链接：redsize.com/560/npk

: Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) mask the real IP and port of the original IP address and port. The mapping between the IP address/port is stored in a table. A scan that creates millions of packets may overwhelm the NAT or PAT tables, causing them to drop packets, including subsequent probes and their responses. Thus, the scanning tool won't see all the results, missing open ports and vulnerabilities. Similarly, a proxy (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS Proxy) could drop or modify traffic it determines is invalid.
 The egress from your testing system and network should have no restrictions on the traffic sent or received. If a network or host-based firewall limits the traffic to your device, you may miss important connections such as callbacks (reverse shells) from exploits.
 For testing across the internet, the testers will, of course, need a fast and reliable internet connection from an ISP.
 The testers will be sending some unusual traffic across that line and their scanning will generate a large number of unusual packets. Furthermore, they may run actual exploits against targets across that ISP. This could be a problem, unless it is cleared with the ISP first. Some ISPs detect network scans and throttle them, slowing down a test. Others block certain TCP and UDP ports for consumer-grade connections (like consumer cable modems, DSL lines, and FIOS) to help protect consumers on their networks. For example, connections to or from TCP port 25 are blocked by some ISPs to lower the chance that email-relaying bots can be installed on their subscribers' PCs. Such port blocking will prevent the tester from evaluating the security of services on those ports. Some ISPs even identify exploitation attempts and then block the exploit packets using network-based IPS tools. Such an action would prevent the tester from moving forward on that part of a test. Any of these issues would result in inaccurate results. Furthermore, performing scanning or exploitation through your ISP's network could be a violation of its terms of service. Violating those terms could result in service termination and a possible lawsuit.
 Because of the concerns associated with using the ISP connection for testing, it is vital that you tell the ISP in advance that you plan on using the connection for penetration testing and security assessments. (You may want to avoid the phrase ethical hacking, as the ISP may misunderstand the term hacking.) It may tell you to seek another ISP, but it is better to determine its policy in advance than to find it out in the middle of a test. It may charge you extra for the connection or force you to buy a different grade of service. Still, such expenditures are a reasonable price of doing business. To avoid these issues, many testers use pen test friendly cloud-based services, such as Linode, Digital Ocean, and AWS.; （PAT）屏蔽了原始IP地址和端口的真实IP和端口。IP地址/端口之间的映射存储在一个表中。创建数百万个数据包的扫描可能会淹没NAT或PAT表，导致它们丢弃数据包，包括后续探测及其响应。因此，扫描工具不会看到所有结果，缺少开放端口和漏洞。类似地，代理（例如HTTP/HTTPS代理）可以删除或修改其确定无效的流量。从测试系统和网络的出口不应限制发送或接收的流量。如果基于网络或主机的防火墙限制了到您设备的流量，您可能会错过重要的连接，例如漏洞攻击的回调（反向外壳）。对于跨互联网测试，测试人员当然需要ISP提供快速可靠的互联网连接。测试人员将通过该线路发送一些异常流量，他们的扫描将生成大量异常数据包。此外，他们可能会对该ISP中的目标进行实际攻击。这可能是一个问题，除非先与ISP确认。一些ISP检测网络扫描并对其进行限制，从而减慢了测试速度。其他人阻止某些TCP和UDP端口用于消费者级连接（如消费者电缆调制解调器、DSL线路和FIO），以帮助保护其网络上的消费者。例如，一些ISP会阻止与TCP端口25的连接，以降低电子邮件中继机器人安装在其用户电脑上的可能性。这种端口阻止将阻止测试人员评估这些端口上服务的安全性。一些ISP甚至会识别攻击企图，然后使用基于网络的IPS工具阻止攻击数据包。这样的操作将阻止测试人员继续进行测试的这一部分。任何这些问题都会导致不准确的结果。此外，通过ISP的网络进行扫描或攻击可能违反其服务条款。违反这些条款可能导致服务终止和可能的诉讼。由于与使用ISP连接进行测试相关的问题，您必须提前告诉ISP您计划使用该连接进行渗透测试和安全评估。（您可能希望避免使用“道德黑客”这一短语，因为ISP可能会误解“黑客”一词。）它可能会告诉您寻求另一家ISP，但最好提前确定其策略，而不是在测试过程中找到它。它可能会对连接收取额外费用，或迫使您购买不同级别的服务。不过，这些支出是做生意的合理价格。为了避免这些问题，许多测试人员使用笔测试友好的基于云的服务，如Linode、Digital Ocean和AWS

: Although we recommend that you avoid using a network or personal firewall to protect your testing machines because of the potential impact on your test results, we do caution you. Make sure you carefully harden the testing machines before starting a test. You must guard against compromise of the attacking machines during a test by either a third-party malicious attacker or even an overexuberant system administrator in the target organization.
 There have been cases of an administrator on a target network launching a counterstrike during a test, hacking back to the penetration tester's machines and compromising them. If someone compromises your testing machines, they could steal your interim test results and even alter the results they leave behind. Such exposure of test results could be, at best, embarrassing, and at worst, catastrophic for your career as a penetration tester or ethical hacker.
 For this reason, keep patches up to date on all your testing machines, and shut off unneeded services. For a penetration testing system, you likely need no or only minimal listening services on the machine. The only services that should be listening are specific ones you need for your test, such as a web server set up to deliver a client-side exploit or a file server needed to serve up files to compromised target machines. You want to increase security settings of the testing machines beyond the defaults for the given operating system, but make sure that you don't inhibit the functionality of your testing tools. Harden the boxes but verify on lab systems that your hardening process doesn't break needed functionality of your test tools. One area of hardening involves configuring a Windows machine to speak the stronger NTLMv2 protocol for authentication using the LMCompatibilityLevel Registry key. To attack less secure Windows servers, the tester's machine needs the capability to speak the older LANMAN Challenge-Response and NTLMvl authentication mechanisms in addition to NTLMv2. We explore the differences between these authentication mechanisms in more detail later in this course. For now, keep in mind that hardening a tester's machine to avoid these older and weaker protocols may hamper the system's capability to attack weakly configured targets.
 To help with this hardening process, the Center for Internet Security (www.cisecurity.org) has a large number of free templates for hardening various kinds of systems, including Windows and Linux. Download and use these templates.
 https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/; 尽管我们建议您避免使用网络或个人防火墙来保护您的测试机器，因为这可能会对您的测试结果产生影响，但我们还是提醒您。在开始测试之前，确保仔细硬化测试机器。在测试过程中，您必须防止第三方恶意攻击者甚至目标组织中过度兴奋的系统管理员破坏攻击机器。在测试过程中，目标网络的管理员发起了反击，黑客攻击渗透测试人员的机器并对其进行破坏。如果有人破坏了你的测试机器，他们可能会窃取你的临时测试结果，甚至改变他们留下的结果。这种测试结果的暴露，充其量是令人尴尬的，最坏的是，对你作为渗透测试人员或道德黑客的职业生涯来说是灾难性的。因此，请在所有测试机上更新补丁程序，并关闭不需要的服务。对于渗透测试系统，您可能不需要或只需要机器上的最小侦听服务。应该侦听的唯一服务是您测试所需的特定服务，例如设置用于提供客户端漏洞的web服务器，或将文件提供给受损目标机器所需的文件服务器。您希望将测试机的安全设置增加到给定操作系统的默认设置之外，但请确保不抑制测试工具的功能。加固盒子，但在实验室系统上验证加固过程不会破坏测试工具所需的功能。强化的一个方面涉及配置Windows机器，使用LMCompatibilityLevel注册表项使用更强的NTLMv2协议进行身份验证。为了攻击安全性较差的Windows服务器，除了NTLMv2之外，测试人员的机器还需要能够说出较旧的LANMAN质询响应和NTLMvl身份验证机制。我们将在本课程后面更详细地探讨这些身份验证机制之间的差异。目前，请记住，强化测试人员的机器以避免这些较旧和较弱的协议可能会阻碍系统攻击配置较弱的目标的能力。为了帮助强化过程，互联网安全中心（www.cisecurity.org）提供了大量免费模板，用于强化各种系统，包括Windows和Linux。下载并使用这些模板。https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks

: In addition to the SANS Slingshot image and other free bootable Linux environments, a variety of websites offer vast arsenals of free tools and exploits, which can be incredibly helpful. The vast majority of professional penetration testers and ethical hackers rely on at least some of these free tools when doing their jobs. Before considering whether you can run such tools in your environment, you need to determine your organization's policy regarding the use of such third-party security assessment and exploitation tools. Some organizations strictly forbid the running of any tools beyond a standard baseline of already-approved tools. Others allow additional tools to be used, but only if they are carefully vetted.
 Consider this scenario: A tester scans a target environment, discovering a listening service that has a version number that is known to be exploitable. With a little research, the tester discovers a freely downloadable exploit for that specific version of the service from an exploit distribution site. Suppose further that the Rules of Engagement for the test allow the actual exploitation of the target machine, and furthermore, the tester's own organization allows for the use of third-party free exploits. What should the tester do? We strongly urge you to be careful with free downloaded tools and exploit code. Historically, some of the tools and exploit code freely distributed on the internet have included backdoors that let a bad guy control any system on which the tool was run or even control the target machine against which the tool was run. Also, some of the tools may cause a crash in a target service or system.
 Thus, we recommend that testers analyze all free tools carefully in a laboratory before using them in a test. If you have the skills, review the source code for the tool before using it, making sure it does exactly what it says it does, with no hidden backdoor functionality or other trojan horse capabilities in the tool. If you cannot review the code, then at a minimum, run the free tool in a laboratory environment, carefully reviewing the traffic it sends across the network (looking for unexpected packets going to unexpected destinations) and any changes it makes in the file system of the attack and target machines. The free Microsoft Sysinternals' Procmon and Sysmon tools are helpful in analyzing file system and Registry interactions. Procmon has subsumed the earlier tools, filemon and regmon, extending their functionality in a single tool.; 除了SAN Slingshot映像和其他可免费启动的Linux环境外，各种网站还提供了大量的免费工具和漏洞利用，这可能会非常有用。绝大多数专业渗透测试人员和道德黑客在工作时至少依赖其中一些免费工具。在考虑是否可以在您的环境中运行此类工具之前，您需要确定组织关于使用此类第三方安全评估和利用工具的策略。一些组织严格禁止在已经批准的工具的标准基线之外运行任何工具。其他人则允许使用其他工具，但前提是这些工具必须经过仔细审查。考虑这种情况：测试人员扫描目标环境，发现具有已知可利用版本号的侦听服务。通过一些研究，测试人员发现了一个可从漏洞分发站点免费下载的该服务特定版本的漏洞。进一步假设测试的参与规则允许实际利用目标机器，此外，测试人员自己的组织允许使用第三方免费利用。测试人员应该做什么？我们强烈建议您小心使用免费下载的工具和漏洞代码。历史上，一些在互联网上自由分发的工具和漏洞代码包括后门，让坏人控制运行工具的任何系统，甚至控制运行工具所针对的目标机器。此外，一些工具可能会导致目标服务或系统崩溃。因此，我们建议测试人员在测试前在实验室仔细分析所有免费工具。如果您具备这些技能，请在使用该工具之前查看其源代码，确保它完全按照它所说的做，并且该工具中没有隐藏的后门功能或其他特洛伊木马功能。如果您无法查看代码，那么至少在实验室环境中运行免费工具，仔细查看它在网络上发送的流量（寻找前往意外目的地的意外数据包）以及它在攻击和目标机器的文件系统中所做的任何更改。免费的Microsoft Sysinternals的Procmon和Sysmon工具有助于分析文件系统和注册表交互。Procmon包含了早期的工具filemon和regmon，在单个工具中扩展了它们的功能

: Although there are numerous exploit and attack tool repositories on the internet, some of the most comprehensive archives that are updated on a regular basis include the Exploit Database and Packet Storm Security. Several other sites come and go on a regular basis, but these sites are long-standing and tend to have relatively higher quality tools.
 The Exploit Database (exploit-db for short) is maintained by the same group that maintains Kali Linux, Offensive Security. Its site hosts more than 10,000 exploits and sorts them into useful categories, such as Remote Exploits, Local Exploits, Web Applications, Denial of Service/Proof of Concept, Shellcode, and Papers. For each exploit in these categories, it lists the platform (Windows, Linux, PHP, and so on) and the author.
 Also, the SEEBUG site has hundreds of categories of vulnerabilities, including exploit code for many different issues that they inventory.
 Packet Storm Security has an archive of attack and defense tools that spans over a decade. It's quite an impressive assortment of useful tools, exploits, and security research papers.
 Note that we are not endorsing these sites or the tools that they distribute. These sites have been quite controversial, and you need to be careful with any code you download from them. Still, ethical hackers and penetration testers need to know about these sites to do their jobs.
 Beyond the tool and exploit sites, numerous vulnerability research sites are also available. Although these sites do not distribute exploit code freely, they do publish information about vulnerabilities. These detailed vulnerability descriptions are invaluable in letting a tester know that there is an issue with a system type or service version discovered in a test. Even though an exploit might not be available (in fact, an exploit may have never been publicly released or even created), the tester still needs to understand the vulnerabilities so that they can be included in the test report.
 Some of the best sites with vulnerability research and detailed descriptions are the following sites: •The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), maintained by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) •The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository operated by Miter; 尽管互联网上有许多攻击和攻击工具库，但定期更新的一些最全面的档案包括攻击数据库和数据包风暴安全。其他几个网站经常来来去去去，但这些网站是长期存在的，往往有相对较高质量的工具。漏洞数据库（简称漏洞数据库）由维护Kali Linux攻击性安全的同一组维护。它的网站托管了10000多个漏洞，并将其分类为有用的类别，例如远程漏洞、本地漏洞、Web应用程序、拒绝服务/概念验证、外壳代码和论文。对于这些类别中的每个漏洞，它列出了平台（Windows、Linux、PHP等）和作者。此外，SEEBUG站点有数百种类型的漏洞，包括针对许多不同问题的漏洞代码。Packet Storm Security拥有一个跨越十年的攻击和防御工具档案。这是一系列令人印象深刻的有用工具、漏洞利用和安全研究论文。请注意，我们并不认可这些网站或它们分发的工具。这些网站一直备受争议，你需要小心从它们下载的任何代码。不过，道德黑客和渗透测试人员需要了解这些网站才能完成他们的工作。除了工具和漏洞利用网站外，还有许多漏洞研究网站。尽管这些网站并不自由发布漏洞代码，但它们确实发布了有关漏洞的信息。这些详细的漏洞描述对于让测试人员知道在测试中发现的系统类型或服务版本存在问题非常重要。即使漏洞可能不可用（事实上，漏洞可能从未公开发布或创建），测试人员仍需要了解漏洞，以便将其包含在测试报告中。具有漏洞研究和详细描述的一些最佳站点包括以下站点：•美国国土安全部（DHS）维护的美国计算机应急准备团队（US-CERT）•Miter运营的常见漏洞和暴露（CVE）存储库

: In addition to the free tools we've been discussing, some penetration testers and ethical hackers rely on commercial tools for testing. There is a large number of commercial tools, with new ones released on a regular basis. The advantages of commercial tools include generally higher quality (but not always), typically more frequent updates (given the vendors' paid teams of software developers), and technical support if issues arise during testing.
 Although this course is taught from a vendor-neutral perspective, professional penetration testers and ethical hackers do need to know about some of the commercially available tools, even if they don't use them. That way, they can make sure that their test regimen made up of noncommercial (free or in-house) tools includes similar concepts and capabilities as the commercial tools. This slide lists a few of the more popular and comprehensive tools for testing.
 Some of the commercial tools commonly used by penetration testers are: •Vulnerability Scanners: Nessus, Nexpose, Saint •Exploitation Toolkits: Rapid7 Metasploit Pro, Core Impact, Immunity Canvas •Web Application Scanners: PortSwigger Burp Suite, Fortify Weblnspect, Trustwave App Scanner, HCL AppScan; 除了我们讨论过的免费工具外，一些渗透测试人员和道德黑客依赖商业工具进行测试。有大量的商业工具，定期发布新的工具。商业工具的优势包括通常更高的质量（但并非总是），通常更频繁的更新（考虑到供应商的付费软件开发团队），以及在测试期间出现问题时的技术支持。虽然本课程是从供应商中立的角度教授的，但专业渗透测试人员和道德黑客确实需要了解一些商业可用的工具，即使他们不使用这些工具。这样，他们可以确保由非商业（免费或内部）工具组成的测试方案包含与商业工具类似的概念和功能。本幻灯片列出了一些更流行、更全面的测试工具。渗透测试人员常用的一些商业工具有：•漏洞扫描器：Nessus、Nexpose、Saint•开发工具包：Rapid7 Metasploit Pro、Core Impact、Immunity Canvas•Web应用程序扫描器：

: Most penetration testers work as part of a team. Even if you are working by yourself, it is important to take good notes so you can save yourself time on future engagements. We recommend you have a knowledge base containing tools, techniques, and command examples to make your attacks more efficient. Also, this is a great way to share with your team, especially new or junior members. The tools are as important, but some of the common tools used are Confluence, a wiki, or OneNote. The exact tools isn't as important as the process. This must be easy to use, search, and update or your team won't use it.
 You will need storage for data specific to the engagement. You will often find keys, certificates, and other artifacts that are useful in the penetration test that you need to (securely) share with other team members. This could be an internal file share, SharePoint, cloud storage, or a Git repository. This needs to be easily accessible and updateable by the team members. Remember to clean up this data when the test is complete! Your team will often have in-house code that needs to be shared with team members. Most teams these days use Git. Other common version control software includes CVS, SVN, Mercurial, and the Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) or Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).
 Your team needs to communicate, so a secure chat mechanism is important. Signal and Telegram offer great security, but the scalability for an enterprise ready tool is lacking. Microsoft Teams, while somewhat behind the curve in the world of chat, offers retention policies to make cleanup automatic. Similarly, Slack offers a retention policy at their paid tier. Many teams using internal services, such as IRC, allow the pen testers to have more control over the data.
 Clients will give you credentials, you will likely acquire new credentials (cracking, guessing, or even cleartext), and you possibly will even create accounts in the target network. It is important to securely share that information with your teammates. There are a number of password vaulting tools that can be useful here, including lPassword, LastPass, and KeyPass. One nice benefit of lPassword is that it also allows you to store some 2FA tokens.
 Finally, we need ways to write reports in a consistent manner. It is a timesaver to have a repository for common vulnerabilities and findings. These findings are pre-vetted prior to going into the report. This allows you to have a good quality base for the finding and you can tweak the finding for the particular scenario or target. This is a; 大多数渗透测试人员都是团队的一部分。即使你是一个人工作，做好笔记也很重要，这样你就可以节省自己在未来约会上的时间。我们建议您拥有包含工具、技术和命令示例的知识库，以提高攻击效率。此外，这是一种与您的团队，尤其是新成员或初级成员分享信息的好方法。这些工具同样重要，但一些常用工具是Confluence、wiki或OneNote。确切的工具不如过程重要。这必须易于使用、搜索和更新，否则您的团队将不会使用它。您将需要存储特定于参与的数据。您经常会发现在渗透测试中有用的密钥、证书和其他工件，需要（安全地）与其他团队成员共享。这可以是内部文件共享、SharePoint、云存储或Git存储库。这需要团队成员易于访问和更新。记住在测试完成后清理这些数据！您的团队通常需要与团队成员共享内部代码。现在大多数团队都使用Git。其他常见的版本控制软件包括CVS、SVN、Mercurial和Microsoft Team Foundation Server（TFS）或Visual Studio Team Services（VSTS）。您的团队需要沟通，因此安全的聊天机制很重要。信号和电报提供了极大的安全性，但缺乏企业级工具的可扩展性。虽然微软团队在聊天领域有些落后，但他们提供了保留策略，以实现自动清理。同样，Slack在其付费层提供了保留策略。许多使用内部服务（如IRC）的团队允许笔测试人员对数据进行更多控制。客户会给你凭据，你可能会获得新的凭据（破解、猜测，甚至明文），你甚至可能会在目标网络中创建帐户。与队友安全地共享这些信息很重要。这里有许多有用的密码保险存储工具，包括lPassword、LastPass和KeyPass。lPassword的一个很好的优点是，它还允许您存储一些2FA令牌。最后，我们需要以一致的方式编写报告。为常见漏洞和发现建立存储库可以节省时间。这些调查结果在进入报告之前经过预先审查。这使您可以为查找建立良好的质量基础，并且可以针对特定场景或目标调整查找。这是一个

: tremendous time saver. The findings in the repository should not contain any target information, making it much safer to copy into a report. Be very careful never to copy data between reports as this can lead to data leakage. The authors of this course have heard of multiple instances were one target's name or details ended up in a report for a different target. This can be embarrassing and undermine your credibility. To make report writing easier for multiple people, a collaborative reporting environment is a nice time savings. Ideally, this allows multiple people to work on the report (and even the same portion of the report) at the same time. Services like Google Docs and SharePoint with Microsoft Office allow for this kind of shared editing. Some penetration testers use version control software (e.g., Git, SVN) to manage reporting, but in the author's experience, this can lead to a number of code/edit conflicts that take extra time to resolve. Some penetration testers use collaborative tools specifically designed for penetration testing. The two most common ones are Dradis and Lair. The Dradis tool is a Ruby-on-Rails project designed for recording information among multiple penetration testers working on one or more projects together. The Dradis server runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS and features multiple client options: a command line client, several different thick client applications, or a web-based interface. All results are organized as a hierarchical tree, typically organized starting by overall project, then split according to functional areas of the target infrastructure (for example, DMZ/intranet/extranet, servers/network devices/clients, or other applicable divisions of the test's scope), then separated by individual devices, down to individual ports on those devices, and then through findings and notes associated with each port. With Dradis, a tester can import results from the Nmap port scanning tool, the Nessus or Qualys network vulnerability scanning tools, the Nikto web server scanning tool, or the Burp web application attack tool. In addition, the tester can manually enter findings and notes or add analytical notes to results already imported. Tom Steele and Dan Kottmann have released an attack collaboration tool known as Lair. It can import data from a variety of scanning tools, including Nmap, Nessus, Nexpose, Burp, and more. Multiple penetration testers can then access it via their web browsers to analyze findings and collaborate on a report.; 节省大量时间。存储库中的结果不应包含任何目标信息，这样可以更安全地复制到报告中。千万不要在报表之间复制数据，因为这可能会导致数据泄漏。本课程的作者听说过多个实例是一个目标的名称或详细信息最终出现在不同目标的报告中。这可能会让人尴尬，并损害你的信誉。为了让多人更容易编写报告，协作报告环境可以节省大量时间。理想情况下，这允许多人同时处理报告（甚至报告的同一部分）。Google Docs和SharePoint与Microsoft Office等服务允许这种共享编辑。一些渗透测试人员使用版本控制软件（例如Git、SVN）来管理报告，但根据作者的经验，这可能会导致大量代码/编辑冲突，需要额外的时间来解决。一些渗透测试人员使用专门为渗透测试设计的协作工具。最常见的两种是Dradis和Lair。Dradis工具是一个Ruby on Rails项目，旨在记录多个渗透测试人员在一起处理一个或多个项目时的信息。Dradis服务器运行在Windows、Linux或macOS上，具有多个客户端选项：命令行客户端、多个不同的厚客户端应用程序或基于web的界面。所有结果都组织为一个层次树，通常从整个项目开始组织，然后根据目标基础设施的功能区域（例如，DMZ/intranet/extranet、服务器/网络设备/客户端或测试范围的其他适用分区）进行拆分，然后由单个设备分隔，直至这些设备上的各个端口，然后通过与每个端口相关的发现和注释。使用Dradis，测试人员可以从Nmap端口扫描工具、Nessus或Qualys网络漏洞扫描工具、Nikto web服务器扫描工具或Burp web应用程序攻击工具导入结果。此外，测试人员可以手动输入结果和注释，或将分析注释添加到已导入的结果中。Tom Steele和Dan Kottmann发布了一个名为Lair的攻击协作工具。它可以从各种扫描工具导入数据，包括Nmap、Nessus、Nexpose、Burp等。然后，多渗透测试人员可以通过他们的web浏览器访问它，以分析结果并在报告上进行协作

: Throughout this session, we use bash, one of the most common command shells in Linux distributions today, as our command shell. This shell includes many ease-of-use features that make interacting with Linux simpler. You should memorize each of these items, as they will save you much time and effort, making Linux a lot friendlier for you.
 Bash, like many other shells, remembers your shell history, letting you access it by pressing the up and down arrows to access and edit recent commands, which you can rerun by simply pressing Enter.
 After you choose a previous command, you can press the left and right arrow keys to position your cursor to edit the command.
 Also, bash supports tab autocomplete for the names of directories and files. When accessing something in the file system, just press Tab for the shell to expand it to a unique name that matches what you've typed so far. If there are multiple items that match what you've typed (that is, there is nothing unique yet), you can press Tab again to show the names of all files or directories in your current working directory that match what you've typed so far.
 That is, Tab expands to a unique value, and Tab-Tab shows all items that match what you've typed so far if nothing is unique.
 You can also search your history in bash by pressing CTRL-R at the start of a command line. Then start typing characters, and bash jumps back to the most recent command that has the characters you typed in that order. You can then press Enter to rerun that command or the left or right arrow key to edit the command.
 The CTRL-L option clears the screen, or you can simply type clear. The CTRL-C command lets you abandon the current command and get back to the command prompt. There is no need to delete the current command by holding down the Backspace or Delete key. Just press CTRL-C to get rid of the current command.
 The Home key included on some keyboards lets you jump to the beginning of a command line, whereas the End key lets you jump to the end. These options can help you jump around in long commands to make altering them easier.; 在整个会话中，我们使用bash作为命令shell，bash是当今Linux发行版中最常见的命令shell之一。这个shell包含许多易于使用的特性，使与Linux的交互更加简单。你应该记住其中的每一项，因为它们会节省你很多时间和精力，使Linux对你来说更友好。与许多其他shell一样，Bash会记住shell历史记录，通过按向上和向下箭头来访问和编辑最近的命令，只需按Enter键即可重新运行这些命令。选择上一个命令后，可以按左右箭头键定位光标以编辑该命令。此外，bash支持目录和文件名的tab自动完成。当访问文件系统中的某些内容时，只需按外壳的Tab键，将其扩展为与您迄今键入的内容匹配的唯一名称。如果有多个项目与您键入的内容相匹配（也就是说，没有唯一的内容），您可以再次按Tab键以显示当前工作目录中与您键入内容相匹配的所有文件或目录的名称。也就是说，Tab扩展到一个唯一的值，并且Tab Tab显示所有与您迄今为止键入的内容匹配的项目（如果没有唯一的内容）。您还可以通过在命令行开头按CTRL-R来在bash中搜索历史记录。然后开始键入字符，bash跳回最新的命令，该命令包含按该顺序键入的字符。然后，可以按Enter键重新运行该命令，或按向左或向右箭头键编辑该命令。CTRL-L选项清除屏幕，也可以简单地键入clear。CTRL-C命令允许您放弃当前命令并返回命令提示符。不需要通过按住Backspace或delete键来删除当前命令。只需按CTRL-C即可摆脱当前命令。某些键盘上的Home键可以跳到命令行的开头，而End键可以跳到末尾。这些选项可以帮助您在长命令中跳转，使更改它们更容易

: The principal of least privilege "states that only the minimum access necessary to perform an operation should be granted, and that access should be granted only for the minimum amount of time necessary" (US-CERT).
 Attackers will often abuse shortcomings in the execution of the principal to escalate permissions or move from a non-privileged user to a privileged user. On a Linux system, the prompt will change depending on the user's access level. Also, the home directory for "root" and regular users are, by default, in different locations.
 Non-root users Have a prompt with a "$" or "%" Home directory similar to: /home/username Root users Have a prompt with a "#" Home directory: /root If you want to create an account, such as a backdoor for persistence, you can use the "useradd" command. The command takes the following options: useradd [options] LOGIN -d HOME_DIR -e EXPIRE_DATE (format YYYY-MM-DD) -u UID (numeric user ID, must be unique unless -o is used. Users with a UID of zero are granted root level access) See more options by running man useradd; 最小特权原则“规定只应授予执行操作所需的最小访问权限，并且只应在必要的最小时间内授予访问权限”（US-CERT）。攻击者通常会滥用主体执行中的缺陷来提升权限或从非特权用户转移到特权用户。在Linux系统上，提示将根据用户的访问级别而变化。此外，“root”和普通用户的主目录在默认情况下位于不同的位置。非root用户有一个带有“$”或“%”主目录的提示，类似于：/Home/username root用户有带有“#”主目录的提示符：/root如果您想创建一个帐户，例如用于持久性的后门，您可以使用“useradd”命令。该命令采用以下选项：useradd[options]LOGIN-d HOME\u DIR-e EXPIRE\u DATE（格式YYYY-MM-DD）-u UID（数字用户ID，除非使用-o，否则必须是唯一的。UID为零的用户被授予根级别访问权限）通过运行man useradd查看更多选项

: There are a few ways to execute commands with elevated permissions. The first option is to use sudo. The sudo command allows us to execute a command as another user, most commonly root. To use sudo, simply prefix another command with sudo. For example, the command below will execute the vim editor as root to allow editing of /etc/passwd.
 sedS& 0@slingshot:~$ sudo vim /etc/passwd Password: sec560 account password You can use the -i option with sudo to run an interactive shell instead of a single command.
 sec560@slingshot:~$ sudo vim /etc/passwd Password: sec560 account password root@slingshot:~# When you run the two commands above, you are prompted for the current account’s password (sec560).
 Assuming the user has the ability to use sudo, the commands would then run successfully as root. The privilege is set in the /etc/sudoers file. In this file, you can specify the executables you are allowed to run and the target user account. There are additional tags that can be set on commands, such as the NOPASSWD tag which tells sudo not to ask for a password. For more details, look at the contents of "man sudo" and "man sudoers".
 Another way to run commands as root is with the "su" (substitute user) command. When this command is run, you will enter the password of the target account, not the original account. Many Linux distributions (including macOS) require you to be in the "wheel" or "admin" groups to run this command. The -1 option (lowercase L, also can be shorted to just a minus "-") will simulate a full login and set the environment variables. The command below will give the user a full root shell.; 有几种方法可以使用提升的权限执行命令。第一种选择是使用sudo。sudo命令允许我们作为另一个用户执行命令，通常是root用户。要使用sudo，只需在另一个命令前面加上sudo。例如，下面的命令将以root身份执行vim编辑器，以允许编辑/etc/passwd。sedS和0@slingshot用法：~$sudo-vim/etc/passwd-Password:sec560帐户密码您可以使用sudo的-i选项来运行交互式shell，而不是单个命令。sec560@slingshot：/sudo vim/etc/passwd密码：sec560帐户密码root@slingshot：~#当您运行上述两个命令时，系统会提示您输入当前帐户的密码（sec560）。假设用户能够使用sudo，那么这些命令将作为root用户成功运行。特权在/etc/sudoers文件中设置。在此文件中，您可以指定允许运行的可执行文件和目标用户帐户。可以在命令上设置其他标记，例如NOPASSWD标记，它告诉sudo不要请求密码。有关更多详细信息，请参阅“man sudo”和“man sudoers”的内容。另一种以root身份运行命令的方法是使用“su”（替换用户）命令。运行此命令时，您将输入目标帐户的密码，而不是原始帐户的密码。许多Linux发行版（包括macOS）要求您在“wheel”或“admin”组中运行此命令。1选项（小写L，也可以缩写为一个负号“-”）将模拟完整登录并设置环境变量。下面的命令将为用户提供完整的根shell

: When you successfully exploit a system, often, you will not know the level of access you have or the user you are running as. One of the first things to do is run the whoami command to determine your user.

In the example below, we have access as a regular user(dark)and then, using a privilege escalation exploit, we gain root permissions,; 当您成功利用系统时，往往不知道您拥有的访问级别或您运行的用户。首先要做的事情之一是运行whoami命令来确定您的用户。要获取有关访问权限的更多信息，可以使用id命令获取数字用户id和组成员身份。在下面的示例中，我们可以作为普通用户（深色）访问，然后使用权限提升漏洞获得根权限

: Executable programs are stored in /bin and /sbin.
 /root is the root login account's home directory. This is hugely important because if you log in directly as root, this will be your initial location in the directory structure. If you log in as an individual user other than root, you'll be put in that user’s directory, typically somewhere inside of /home.
 /dev stores devices (drives, terminals, etc.).
 /etc holds configuration items, like the account information (stored in /etc/passwd) and hashed passwords (stored in /etc/shadow).
 /home contains users' home directories.
 /lib contains common libraries.
 /mnt is where various remote and temporary file systems (CD-ROMs, floppies, etc.) are attached.
 /proc is a virtual file system used to store kernel info.
 /tmp is for temporary data and is usually cleared at reboot.
 /usr holds user programs and other data.

: All the VMs will use DHCP to dynamically acquire IP address and network information.
 For most labs, we will be using "NAT Networking", where your VMs are bridged to the in-class network. For all intents and purposes, they are on the class network. When you are on this network, your VM should have an IP address in the range of 10.10.7X.XXX.
 For a few labs, where we have to perform more dangerous actions, you will switch your VMs to "Host-only Networking". When on this network, your host will likely have an address in the 172.16.X.X range, but it could be different depending on your host configuration. It is highly unlikely that you would end up with a 10.10.7X.XXX address. If you have this address and you have confirmed you have switched to Host-only networking, you should request a new IP address (instructions to follow).
 You will not use your host system in any of the lab networks; however, your host will get an IP address on the lab network, so make sure you have the latest software patches and host protections in place.

: The overall penetration testing process involves preparation, testing, and conclusion phases.
 During the preparation phase, the parties participating in the test may sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), especially if the test is conducted by a third-party organization. Then the testers and the target personnel discuss the most significant concerns of the target organization. What are the biggest threats? Which systems are the most sensitive? What kind of information is the most valuable? We also agree on Rules of Engagement that describe how the testing will occur. Next, the scope of the test is determined, a process we'll discuss in depth later.
 The next step is absolutely crucial. You need to get official, written permission to conduct the test, even if it is against targets in your own organization. This permission should notify the personnel associated with the target systems that there is some danger of their systems being crashed or impaired by the testing. We'll discuss this permission memo in more detail shortly. Then, based on the nature of the test, a team of appropriate testers is assigned based on its technical areas of expertise and business knowledge of the target environment.
 The test then occurs, potentially lasting from a day to many months.
 To conclude, the team then analyzes the results, trying to discern their business implications. The technical details and business implications are described in detail in a final report. As findings are addressed, single-issue retests could occur, or an entire comprehensive retest may happen. Some tests conclude with a wrap-up final presentation.; 整个渗透测试过程包括准备、测试和结论阶段。在准备阶段，参与测试的各方可以签署保密协议（NDA），特别是如果测试由第三方组织进行。然后，测试人员和目标人员讨论目标组织最重要的关注点。最大的威胁是什么？哪些系统最敏感？什么样的信息最有价值？我们还同意描述测试将如何进行的参与规则。接下来，确定测试的范围，我们稍后将深入讨论这个过程。下一步绝对至关重要。您需要获得正式的书面许可才能进行测试，即使它是针对您自己组织中的目标。该许可应通知与目标系统相关的人员，他们的系统有可能因测试而崩溃或受损。我们稍后将更详细地讨论此许可备忘录。然后，根据测试的性质，根据其专业技术领域和目标环境的业务知识，分配适当的测试人员团队。然后进行测试，可能持续一天到几个月。最后，团队分析结果，试图识别其业务含义。最终报告详细描述了技术细节和业务影响。随着调查结果的解决，可能会进行单问题重新测试，也可能会进行整个全面的重新测试。一些测试以总结性的最终陈述结束

: The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a document called Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment that covers network penetration testing methodologies at a high level. The document addresses the processes commonly applied in testing, planning for tests, conducting a detailed analysis, and dealing with the validation of discovered issues. It also includes appendices that cover some common tools used in vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
 Another useful appendix is a template for Rules of Engagement, helping testers and target system personnel agree upon various vital aspects of how the testing will be conducted. We'll spend some time later in this book discussing Rules of Engagement.
 One of the most useful aspects of the NIST guide is the motivation it can help us inspire in management. If management suggests that our testing methodology shouldn't include some vital component that NIST recommends, we can ask our management why they want to deviate from NIST's guidance. Management may then provide a business rationale for doing so or decide that complying with the NIST document is a better practice than they originally anticipated. Either way, we get a better test more attuned to the business needs of our enterprises.
 Another document from NIST also addresses measuring security in an organization. Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations,Special Publication 800-53A, is at a higher level than SP 800-115 but still provides some useful tips for planning assessments.
 Free at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-l15/fmal Short link:redsiege.com/560/nist; 美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）发布了一份名为《信息安全测试和评估技术指南》的文件，涵盖了高水平的网络渗透测试方法。本文件阐述了测试、测试规划、进行详细分析和处理发现问题的验证中常用的过程。它还包括附录，涵盖了漏洞评估和渗透测试中使用的一些常见工具。另一个有用的附录是参与规则模板，帮助测试人员和目标系统人员就如何进行测试的各个重要方面达成一致。我们将在本书后面花一些时间讨论交战规则。NIST指南最有用的一个方面是它可以帮助我们激发管理动机。如果管理层建议我们的测试方法不应包括NIST建议的一些重要组成部分，我们可以询问我们的管理层为什么他们想要偏离NIST的指导。然后，管理层可以提供这样做的商业理由，或决定遵守NIST文件是比他们最初预期的更好的做法。无论哪种方式，我们都能得到更好的测试，更符合我们企业的业务需求。NIST的另一份文件也涉及衡量组织中的安全性。特别出版物800-53A《评估联邦信息系统和组织中的安全和隐私控制》的水平高于SP 800-115，但仍为规划评估提供了一些有用的提示。免费时间https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-l15/fmal短链接：RedSize.com/560/nist

: Next is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide. Unlike the other broad and generalpurpose methodologies we've touched on so far, the OWASP guide focuses purely on web application security testing. From a web app perspective, this document is an excellent description of the various kinds of testing that need to be done, providing great depth and a wide variety of tools to use in the process.
 One of the best aspects of the OWASP guide is its detailed description of determining the business risk posed by findings. The OWASP guide rates risk based on the impact it could have to the business and the likelihood it has of occurring. From those two aspects, the overall risk rating of a given finding is derived, giving the enterprise appropriate guidance on prioritizing the findings.

: MITRE ATT&CK (pronounced "attack") is a knowledge base of attack tactics based on real-world attackers. The framework includes many techniques (and sub-techniques) used by good and bad attackers. It is valuable resources for learning new tools and techniques. The techniques are grouped together into "tactics". For example, the "Initial Access" tactic includes the techniques Exploit Public Facing Application, Phishing, Valid Accounts among others.
 The tactics and techniques are pieces used by an attacker. ATT&CK also includes "Groups", which is a set of related activity tracked to a common adversary group (e.g., APTI, FIN7). These provide the story of various breaches, which we can use to leam when and how to use specific attacks.
 The combination of the Groups and the Tactics/Techniques make ATT&CK a valuable resource to develop our own offensive skills.
 MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise can be found at https://attack.mitre.org/beta/; MITRE ATT&CK（发音为“攻击”）是基于真实世界攻击者的攻击战术知识库。该框架包括好的和坏的攻击者使用的许多技术（和子技术）。它是学习新工具和技术的宝贵资源。这些技术被归为“战术”。例如，“初始访问”策略包括利用面向公众的应用程序、网络钓鱼、有效帐户等技术。战术和技术是攻击者使用的部分。ATT&CK还包括“组”，这是一组跟踪到常见对手组的相关活动（例如，APTI、FIN7）。这些提供了各种漏洞的故事，我们可以使用这些故事来了解何时以及如何使用特定的攻击。团队和战术/技术的结合使ATT&CK成为发展我们自己进攻技能的宝贵资源。企业的MITRE ATT&CK矩阵可在https://attack.mitre.org/beta

: It is absolutely vital that you get signed permission from an authorized person at the target organization giving you permission to test its environment. This memo is sometimes called a "Get Out of Jail Free Card".
 There is a free sample memo on the Counter Hack website at www.counterhack.net/permission memo.html.
 Among other things, this memo states: The purpose of this memo is to grant authorization to specific members of our information security team to conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests against this organization's assets. To that end, the undersigned attests to the following: 1) [Insert name of tester], [Insert name of tester], and [Insert name of tester] have permission to scan the organization's computer equipment to find vulnerabilities. This permission is grantedfor from [insert start date] until [insert end date], 2) [Insert name of approver] has the authority to grant this permission for testing the organization's Information Technology assets.
 Have your legal team review, tweak, and approve this language. Then, print it on corporate letterhead and have a Chief Information Officer or similar level of management sign-off on it. Note that this memo is suitable for employees to test the security of computer equipment owned by their employers, not for third-party tests.
 Third-party testers require significantly more paperwork since they do not work directly for the company. The contract language should be drawn up by a lawyer to ensure neither party is put at undue risk. Common language includes a limitation of lability (commonly limited to the value of the contract), ownership of intellectual property, and payment terms. The report is often owned by the penetration testing company and then licensed to the client in perpetuity. If the client owned the report, then there could be an issue reusing language in the report (such as text associated with common finding). Additionally, many clients will require insurance of between US$1M and 5M+. The key to contracting is that they are not designed to help you when things go well, they are designed to handle things when things go poorly. Too many times, pen testers and/or clients have been stiffed in payment or deliverables because the request was not properly documented or approved. While contracting can be daunting, do not overlook it or you may not get what you expect.; 获得目标组织授权人员的签字许可，允许您测试其环境，这一点至关重要。这份备忘录有时被称为“出狱免卡”。反黑客网站www.counterhack上有一份免费的备忘录样本。net/permission memo.html。除其他外，本备忘录声明：本备忘录的目的是授权我们的信息安全团队的特定成员对本组织的资产进行漏洞评估和渗透测试。为此，以下签字人证明：1）[插入测试人员姓名]、[插入测试人员名称]和[插入测试人员名字]有权扫描组织的计算机设备以发现漏洞。此权限从[插入开始日期]到[插入结束日期]授予，2）[插入批准人姓名]有权授予此权限以测试组织的信息技术资产。让您的法律团队审查、调整并批准此语言。然后，将其打印在公司信头上，并由首席信息官或类似级别的管理人员签字。请注意，本备忘录适用于员工测试其雇主拥有的计算机设备的安全性，而不适用于第三方测试。第三方测试人员需要更多的文书工作，因为他们不直接为公司工作。合同语言应由律师起草，以确保任何一方都不会面临不应有的风险。通用语言包括不稳定性限制（通常限于合同价值）、知识产权所有权和付款条件。该报告通常由渗透测试公司所有，然后永久许可给客户。如果客户拥有该报告，那么在重用报告中的语言（例如与常见发现相关的文本）时可能会出现问题。此外，许多客户将需要100万至500万美元以上的保险。签约的关键是，他们不是为了在事情顺利时帮助你，而是为了在事情不顺利时处理事情。很多时候，笔试人员和/或客户在付款或交付方面受到阻碍，因为请求没有得到适当的记录或批准。虽然签约可能会让人望而却步，但不要忽视它，否则你可能得不到你想要的

: Many countries have instituted laws for dealing with crimes committed using a computer, so-called cybercrime laws. Not all countries have such laws, and indeed, attackers sometimes move to countries or operate through countries without such laws or where cybercrime laws are not enforced.
 As penetration testers and ethical hackers, we want to make sure we carefully adhere to the laws of the countries in which we operate. In essence, conduct all your tests according to agreed-upon Rules of Engagement with a clearly defined scope. Attack only machines for which you have explicit permission, in written form, from both their owners and operators.
 Your Permission Memo (the Get Out of Jail Free Card) is a helpful thing in ensuring that you have the permission of the target organization that owns and operates the systems you will test.
 It is important to note that the tester has to follow not only the laws where the tester is located but also the laws in the country where the target machines are located. Furthermore, some countries (such as the United States) have indicated that any packets associated with a computer crime that traverse the country's borders fall within their law enforcement jurisdiction, regardless of where the packets originate or terminate. In other words, an attack from Germany against targets in Japan that traverse US networks would be subject not only to German and Japanese law but also to US law.
 Because some of the legal issues associated with testing in different countries can grow complex, we strongly recommend that you consult a lawyer when testing in a country where you haven't tested before. The lawyer can help explain the rules of the road to you, helping to make sure you don't run afoul of the law. For the most part, with a carefully documented Permission Memo, Rules of Engagement agreement, and Project Scope, you can operate in most countries legally without incident. Still, a lawyer's review can be helpful in establishing peace of mind and making sure you've taken any late-breaking legal issues into account when formulating your test plans.; 许多国家制定了处理使用计算机犯罪的法律，即所谓的网络犯罪法。并非所有国家都有此类法律，事实上，攻击者有时会转移到没有此类法律或网络犯罪法律没有执行的国家或通过这些国家开展活动。作为渗透测试人员和道德黑客，我们希望确保认真遵守我们运营所在国家的法律。本质上，根据约定的接洽规则在明确定义的范围内进行所有测试。仅攻击您拥有其所有者和操作员以书面形式明确许可的机器。您的许可备忘录（免出狱卡）有助于确保您获得拥有和操作您将测试的系统的目标组织的许可。需要注意的是，测试人员不仅必须遵守测试人员所在地的法律，还必须遵守目标机器所在国的法律。此外，一些国家（如美国）表示，与穿越该国边境的计算机犯罪有关的任何数据包都属于其执法管辖范围，无论数据包来自何处或终止。换言之，德国对穿越美国网络的日本目标的攻击将不仅受到德国和日本法律的约束，而且也受到美国法律的约束。由于与在不同国家进行测试相关的一些法律问题可能会变得复杂，我们强烈建议您在以前没有测试过的国家进行测试时咨询律师。律师可以帮你解释交通规则，确保你不触犯法律。在大多数情况下，通过仔细记录的许可备忘录、接洽协议规则和项目范围，您可以在大多数国家合法运营，不会发生任何事故。尽管如此，律师的审查仍有助于建立内心的平静，并确保在制定测试计划时考虑到任何迟发的法律问题

: Next we will cover what happens before we begin the penetration test, the pre-engagement phase. This phase includes the legal paperwork, contracting, rules of engagement, scoping and the kick-off. Both the people responsible for the target environment and the testing team must agree on these rules. Without properly agreed upon test, a penetration test or ethical hacking project could go seriously awry, resulting in devastating consequences for the target organization and the testers, including system downtime, financial damage, reputational damage, personnel firing, and possibly civil lawsuits or even criminal prosecutions.; 接下来，我们将介绍在开始渗透测试之前发生的事情，即预接触阶段。这一阶段包括法律文书、合同、接洽规则、范围界定和启动。负责目标环境的人员和测试团队都必须同意这些规则。如果没有适当商定的测试，渗透测试或道德黑客项目可能会严重出错，对目标组织和测试人员造成毁灭性后果，包括系统停机、财务损失、声誉损失、人员解雇，甚至可能发生民事诉讼甚至刑事起诉

: Many third-party penetration testers have gone through the test hundreds of times, but that doesn't mean you can't be prepared as well, even if it is your first time procuring a penetration test. This process is important for both the penetration testers and the recipients of the test. Don't be afraid to ask questions of the other side. It is always better to ask "dumb" questions and get the answer you expect than to assume and be wrong.
 The process to define a high-value penetration test can be daunting for people new to the process. The most important thing for both sides to understand are the goals. First, what is the sensitive data or process that if compromised, stolen, or destroyed would cause the greatest impact to the organization. Second, why is the test being performed (compliance, new system deployment, audit requirement, ...)? The next question to discuss is the type of tests to perform. If the test is executed for compliance reasons, then the type of tests often are straight forward. Otherwise, the aforementioned goals can help channel this discussion.
 Once the tests are decided upon, the scope is often self-evident. As the penetration tester, make sure you ask about systems that are out of scope and the systems owned by third parties.
 The Rules of Engagement is usually a checklist based on the test types selected. There are a few discussion points that we will go into in more depth later.
 Finally, you will need to determine communication methods and points of contact.
 We'll go through each of these items in more depth in the following section.; 许多第三方渗透测试人员已经经历了数百次测试，但这并不意味着你不能做好准备，即使这是你第一次获得渗透测试。这一过程对渗透测试人员和测试接收者都很重要。不要害怕向对方提问。提出“愚蠢”的问题并得到你期望的答案总比假设和错误要好。定义高价值渗透测试的过程对于新手来说可能令人畏惧。对双方来说，最重要的是要理解进球。首先，什么是敏感数据或流程，如果泄露、被盗或销毁，会对组织造成最大影响。第二，为什么要执行测试（合规性、新系统部署、审计要求等）？下一个要讨论的问题是要执行的测试类型。如果测试是出于符合性原因执行的，那么测试的类型通常是直接的。否则，上述目标可以帮助引导这一讨论。一旦确定了测试，范围往往不言而喻。作为渗透测试人员，请确保询问超出范围的系统以及第三方拥有的系统。参与规则通常是基于所选测试类型的检查表。我们将在后面更深入地讨论几个要点。最后，您需要确定沟通方法和联系点。在下一节中，我们将更深入地讨论其中的每一项

: It is very important to have and share the goals of the penetration tests before having further discussions.
 Understanding and acknowledging these goals will help guide the entire test as well as the preparation discussions. As the tester, never assume you know the important data or processes of the target, even if they are part of the company. The target has inside knowledge of the systems that you do not have. Even if you are an inhouse tester, you may not know the details of the target. Ask the question, "What data or process if lost, stolen, compromised, or destroyed would cause the greatest impact to your organization". If you aren't comfortable asking a "dumb" question then try leading with, "I think I know the answer, but I'd rather ask than assume and be wrong".
 You might get the answer you expect, but that's alright. It is better to ask the question and get the answer you expect rather than to assume and be wrong. Being wrong means the focus of the test is incorrect and can greatly impact the value of the test.; 在进行进一步讨论之前，了解并分享渗透测试的目标非常重要。理解并承认这些目标将有助于指导整个测试以及准备讨论。作为测试人员，永远不要假设你知道目标的重要数据或过程，即使它们是公司的一部分。目标具有您不具备的系统内部知识。即使您是室内测试人员，也可能不知道目标的详细信息。提出这样一个问题：“如果丢失、被盗、泄露或销毁了哪些数据或流程，会对您的组织造成最大的影响”。如果你不喜欢问一个“愚蠢”的问题，那么试着用“我想我知道答案，但我宁愿问，也不愿假设自己错了”。你可能会得到你期望的答案，但没关系。最好是提出问题并得到你期望的答案，而不是假设并犯错。错误意味着测试的重点不正确，并且会极大地影响测试的价值

: After establishing the goals, we should talk through the tests that meet those goals. Will the test merely be a network scan for targets and vulnerabilities, which would include a ping sweep, port scan, and vulnerability scan? Or should the testers go further and actually penetrate the target systems, getting access (such as a remote shell) on the targets if possible? If penetration is allowed, should it focus on listening network services, or will clientside software exploitation be allowed as well? Client-side software exploitation is a dominant attack vector today.
 If client-side exploitation is allowed, which client machines will be included in the scope? If exploitation of any kind is allow, should the attackers continue to pivot through the organization? Will the test include any application-level or client-side web component testing? Will it include physical penetration attempts, with the team trying to walk into an environment? Should social engineering, which involves duping human beings, typically via the telephone, be attempted? Your Rules of Engagement should specify each element on this list that is included in the scope.; 在确定目标后，我们应该讨论实现这些目标的测试。测试是否仅仅是对目标和漏洞的网络扫描，包括ping扫描、端口扫描和漏洞扫描？或者测试人员是否应该进一步深入目标系统，在可能的情况下访问目标系统（如远程外壳）？如果允许渗透，它应该专注于监听网络服务，还是也应该允许客户端软件开发？客户端软件攻击是当今占主导地位的攻击向量。如果允许客户端攻击，哪些客户端机器将包括在范围内？如果允许任何类型的攻击，攻击者是否应该继续在组织中转移？测试是否包括任何应用程序级或客户端web组件测试？它会包括团队试图进入环境的物理渗透尝试吗？是否应该尝试通过电话欺骗人类的社会工程？您的参与规则应指定此列表中包含在范围内的每个元素

: A tight definition of scope is better for everyone. One of the most important elements to include in the project scope is a succinct statement of what is to be tested. Spell out explicitly those domain names, network address ranges, individual hosts, and particular applications that are included in the test.
 Also, if there are particularly sensitive elements of the organization that should not be tested, explicitly spell out that list of off-limits machines.
 While the team is performing the test, they may discover additional systems within network address ranges or domain names that weren't considered in the original formulation of the scope. Make sure the Rules of Engagement direct the testing team to check with the target organization before testing any other machines outside of the original scope that are discovered through reconnaissance or scanning after the test starts.
 Even if the test is a "zero-knowledge" assessment, get approval for new targets as you find them. It is better to confirm than to attack outside assets and risk legal action.
 Even with a defined scope, the test is often restricted to a specific duration. The scope and duration should be defined together to ensure sufficient coverage of the targets.; 严格定义范围对每个人都有利。项目范围中要包含的最重要的元素之一是要测试的内容的简洁说明。明确说明测试中包括的域名、网络地址范围、单个主机和特定应用程序。此外，如果组织中存在不应测试的特别敏感元素，请明确列出该禁止机器列表。当团队执行测试时，他们可能会发现网络地址范围或域名内的其他系统，这些系统在范围的原始公式中没有考虑。在测试开始后通过侦察或扫描发现的原始范围外的任何其他机器之前，确保接战规则指示测试团队与目标组织进行检查。即使测试是“零知识”评估，也要在发现新目标时获得批准。与其攻击外部资产并冒险采取法律行动，不如进行确认。即使有一个定义的范围，测试通常也被限制在特定的持续时间内。范围和持续时间应一起定义，以确保目标的充分覆盖

	- 
: If any systems owned or managed by third parties are included in the scope, make sure to get documented permission from these parties before the test begins. The target organization is responsible for getting this permission, and the testers are responsible for making sure the target organization does this.
 Many major organizations today use at least one third party to manage at least part of their computing and network infrastructure. Some companies outsource this altogether, with their infrastructure actually being owned by the third party itself. Examples include Internet Service Providers, whose routers, switches, mail servers, and DNS servers may fall into the scope of a test.
 Always remember that permission is the only difference between a "good guy" and a "bad guy". If the target organization has assets in the cloud, that client is unlikely to have permission to authorize a penetration test.
 Check the contract language before beginning a pen test. Of course, it never hurts to double check to make sure everyone is legal and has permission. An extra check up front can reduce the likelihood of the cloud provider taking your systems offline or shunning the penetration testers (and wasting the tester’s time).
 For third-party-provided clouds, check the contract to see if it allows or explicitly forbids security assessments or penetration tests. Most cloud providers explicitly forbid such tests unless you specifically ask for and receive written permission. Some cloud providers will simply provide the results for their most recent assessment to their customers upon request or choose a specific set of testers to honor a client's request for a needed test. We've seen many cloud providers that offer underlying virtualized systems, in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) arrangement, allow customers to perform application-level testing (such as web app testing) but prohibit them from testing for underlying network and listening service flaws. Both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS allow penetration testing without pre-approval (subject to limitations).
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement https://aws.amazon.com/securitv/penetration-testing/ Many Software as a Service (SaaS) providers prohibit customers from conducting their own tests, whether at the network/service layer or the application layer. Make sure you get appropriate written permission before launching any tests.; 如果第三方拥有或管理的任何系统包含在范围内，请确保在测试开始之前获得这些方的书面许可。目标组织负责获得该权限，测试人员负责确保目标组织做到这一点。如今，许多主要组织至少使用一个第三方来管理其计算和网络基础设施的至少一部分。一些公司将其全部外包，其基础设施实际上由第三方自己拥有。示例包括互联网服务提供商，其路由器、交换机、邮件服务器和DNS服务器可能属于测试范围。永远记住，许可是“好人”和“坏人”之间的唯一区别。如果目标组织在云中有资产，则该客户机不太可能拥有授权渗透测试的权限。在开始笔试之前检查合同语言。当然，反复检查以确保每个人都是合法的，并且都得到了许可，这是无伤大雅的。额外的检查可以减少云提供商让您的系统离线或避开渗透测试人员（并浪费测试人员的时间）的可能性。对于第三方提供的云，检查合同是否允许或明确禁止安全评估或渗透测试。大多数云提供商明确禁止此类测试，除非您明确要求并获得书面许可。一些云提供商只需根据客户的要求向其提供最新评估的结果，或者选择一组特定的测试人员来满足客户对所需测试的要求。我们已经看到许多云提供商在平台即服务（PaaS）或基础设施即服务（IaaS）安排中提供底层虚拟化系统，允许客户执行应用程序级测试（如web app测试），但禁止他们测试底层网络和侦听服务缺陷。Microsoft Azure和Amazon AWS都允许在没有预先批准的情况下进行渗透测试（受限制）。https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement https://aws.amazon.com/securitv/penetration-testing/许多软件即服务（SaaS）提供商禁止客户在网络/服务层或应用层进行自己的测试。在启动任何测试之前，请确保获得适当的书面许可

: It is important to establish the Rules of Engagement (ROE) before beginning the test. It is always better to ask simple questions rather than to assume and later be wrong. You could end up reducing the value of the penetration test, wasting both time and money. The consequences could be far worse, you could receive angry calls from other business units, other companies, service providers, or other third-party companies. In effect, someone attacked them, possibly giving them legal standing for a suit against you! Plan carefully in advance to minimize that risk.
 Documentation of the ROE, and a target signature is a useful tool. At some point in your career, something bad will happen to a target, and that signature can be a powerful tool, especially if the authorizer conveniently says they did not authorize a specific action. This is never a fun experience, but that signature could save your job or career.
 The ROE discussion doesn't have to be a complex discussion. Describe the basic process of the test and the safe actions, such as scanning, password guessing, and normal use of protocols (login via RDP, access via SSH, etc.).
 Of course, never guarantee your actions will never cause harm. Systems crash on their own and we can't control that; unforeseen circumstances always exist. Informing the target that you will take care to perform only reasonably safe actions and any riskier options will require additional approval. Higher-risk issues will often require justification (outline of the goal) to even be considered. Be prepared to do this testing during a maintenance window.
 You can ask about Denial of Service (DOS) attacks but know that it is very likely the target will decline such testing. We recommend not pushing the target on denial of service (DOS) attacks unless you can demonstrate an attack that will help you complete your objective.; 在开始测试之前，制定交战规则（ROE）很重要。问一些简单的问题总比假设然后就错了要好。最终可能会降低渗透测试的价值，浪费时间和金钱。后果可能更糟，你可能会接到来自其他业务部门、其他公司、服务提供商或其他第三方公司的愤怒电话。实际上，有人攻击了他们，可能给了他们起诉你的合法地位！事先仔细计划，将风险降至最低。ROE的文档和目标签名是一个有用的工具。在你职业生涯的某个时刻，目标会发生不好的事情，而这个签名可能是一个强大的工具，尤其是当授权人方便地说他们没有授权特定的行动时。这从来都不是一个有趣的经历，但这个签名可以挽救你的工作或职业生涯。ROE讨论不一定是一个复杂的讨论。描述测试的基本过程和安全操作，例如扫描、密码猜测和协议的正常使用（通过RDP登录、通过SSH访问等）。当然，永远不要保证你的行为不会造成伤害。系统自行崩溃，我们无法控制；不可预见的情况总是存在的。通知目标公司，您将注意只执行合理安全的操作，任何风险较高的选项都需要额外批准。更高风险的问题往往需要考虑理由（目标大纲）。准备在维护期间进行此测试。您可以询问拒绝服务（DOS）攻击，但知道目标很可能会拒绝此类测试。我们建议不要将目标推到拒绝服务（DOS）攻击上，除非您能够演示一种有助于您完成目标的攻击

: Of course, the Rules of Engagement should explicitly state the start and end dates of the test, as well as valid test times.
 Some penetration tests and ethical hacking projects run around the clock, whereas others with more sensitive infrastructures and business needs require testing during off-hours or weekends only. When such off-hours tests are conducted by a third-party company, there is typically a slight, additional charge for such off-hours testing, but it is usually quite reasonable. Also, such limited testing time windows require a longer total duration to complete the test.; 当然，参与规则应该明确说明测试的开始和结束日期，以及有效的测试时间。一些渗透测试和道德黑客项目日以继夜地运行，而另一些具有更敏感基础设施和业务需求的项目只需要在非工作时间或周末进行测试。当此类非工作时间测试由第三方公司进行时，通常会对此类非工作时测试收取少量额外费用，但这通常是相当合理的。此外，这种有限的测试时间窗口需要更长的总持续时间来完成测试

: Here's another point that can cause controversy with some target organizations: Should the penetration test be announced to the people responsible for running the target infrastructure? Or will the test be a surprise to them? Performing an unannounced test does have some advantages. First, if any of your admins are purposely running backdoors or side businesses on your servers, the testing team might find them during an unannounced test. If you announce the test, the admins will likely temporarily shut off their shifty activities during the test duration. Some penetration testers have discovered deliberate, sys-admin-planted backdoors during an unannounced test. Other testers have identified pay-for-pom services on target web servers that were run by the web administrator. Such findings are important results of a penetration test.
 Second, an unannounced test gives you a chance to evaluate the detection and response mechanisms and processes of the target organization. Does information flow properly through the organization concerning a computer attack? However, unannounced tests also have a downside. The system or network administrators might detect the attack and start shunning the traffic, blocking it from reaching the target systems. Then any testing activities after the shunning is applied are invalid, a waste of time and money. If you do perform an unannounced test, make sure the system and network administrators are watched to verify that no shunning occurs.
 Also, to prevent controversy about such tests, make sure that target personnel know that they could occur at any time and are just a normal part of the way the organization does business.; 还有一点可能会引起一些目标组织的争议：渗透测试是否应该向负责运行目标基础设施的人员宣布？还是这次测试会让他们大吃一惊？进行未经宣布的测试确实有一些优势。首先，如果您的任何管理员有意在您的服务器上运行后门或辅助业务，测试团队可能会在未经宣布的测试中找到他们。如果您宣布测试，管理员可能会在测试期间暂时关闭他们的移动活动。一些渗透测试人员发现，在一次未经宣布的测试中，系统管理员故意设置了后门。其他测试人员已经确定了由web管理员运行的目标web服务器上的付费pom服务。这些发现是渗透测试的重要结果。其次，未经宣布的测试为您提供了评估目标组织的检测和响应机制和流程的机会。有关计算机攻击的信息是否在组织内正常流动？然而，未经宣布的测试也有缺点。系统或网络管理员可能会检测到攻击，并开始回避流量，阻止其到达目标系统。那么，应用回避后的任何测试活动都是无效的，浪费时间和金钱。如果您确实执行了未经宣布的测试，请确保系统和网络管理员受到监视，以验证没有发生回避。此外，为了防止对此类测试产生争议，请确保目标人员知道这些测试可能随时发生，并且只是组织开展业务方式的正常组成部分

: Another aspect to take into account with shunning involves what to do afterward. If manual or automated shunning occurs, will that conclude the test? And if so, was the test successful? Also, if and when shunning is engaged, make sure the target organization contacts the testing team to let it know and to determine which of the three options on the previous page you will utilize.
 Some organizations have deployed automated shunning functionality. If an IDS spots an attack, it could reconfigure a firewall to automagically block it. Such functionality could lead to a denial-of-service attack, perhaps even inadvertently by the penetration testing team.
 The Rules of Engagement must explicitly take into account any automated shunning functionality the target organization may have. Auto shunning that is too widely applied could turn a run-of-the-mill penetration test into a denial-of-service attack. Or narrowly focused blocking would just render much of the test useless. To avoid these conditions, you should do one of the following, and document it in the Rules of Engagement: •Have target organization personnel disengage shunning functionality.
 •Include an exception for the source addresses of the testing organization.
 •Announce the test and get an alert when shunning starts so that it can be manually deactivated, allowing traffic from testers through.; 回避要考虑的另一个方面是之后要做什么。如果发生手动或自动回避，测试是否结束？如果是这样，测试成功了吗？此外，如果使用回避，请确保目标组织联系测试团队，让其知道，并确定您将使用上一页中的三个选项中的哪一个。一些组织已经部署了自动回避功能。如果IDS发现攻击，它可以重新配置防火墙以自动阻止它。这种功能可能会导致拒绝服务攻击，甚至可能是渗透测试团队无意中发起的攻击。接洽规则必须明确考虑目标组织可能具有的任何自动回避功能。应用太广泛的自动回避可能会将普通渗透测试变成拒绝服务攻击。或者狭义的阻塞只会使大部分测试变得无用。为了避免这些情况，您应该执行以下操作之一，并将其记录在接洽规则中：•让目标组织人员脱离回避功能包括测试机构的源地址例外情况宣布测试并在开始回避时获得警报，以便可以手动停用，允许测试人员的流量通过

: Here's another point of some controversy. Should the testing team be given a copy of the network diagram, listing hosts, topology, operating systems, and so on? Such crystal-box testing allows testers to see inside the target before launching any scans. Alternatively, the test might be a zero-knowledge engagement, where the testing team is given only a domain name and is expected to figure out the network topology and targets through reconnaissance and scanning.
 The reasons some organizations say that they opt for zero-knowledge testing is that it is "more like what a realworld hacker would see in our environment". Unfortunately, that's not necessarily true. A real-world attacker might have a picture of your network architecture, stolen from a dumpster, faxed from a duped employee, or swiped by a temporary employee. Working from a network diagram lets the penetration testing team analyze a worst-case scenario from the target's perspective.
 A better argument for zero-knowledge testing is that some organizations are worried that a network diagram may bias the testers so that they miss items. Many network diagrams have significant limitations or errors, missing a lot of detail and sometimes overlooking hosts or whole networks.
 In the end, full-knowledge testing tends to be more cost effective because the attackers can quickly perform their reconnaissance and scanning. There is also a lowered chance of an error causing damage to an out-of-scope system. Although most penetration testers perform both zero-knowledge and full-knowledge testing, the latter approach is usually recommended. Of course, you could take a hybrid approach in which the testing team starts out with nothing more than a domain name and performs detailed recon and scanning. Then after a week or so, the target organization provides a detailed diagram for further testing and analysis. When performing such hybrid testing, explicitly label in your report the elements the testers discovered and which items were given to them by the target organization. Hybrid tests usually take a little longer and therefore cost somewhat more. You can use the daily debriefing conference call on a zero-knowledge penetration test to start asking more questions, which could transition the project into a more full-knowledge-style test.; 这是另一个有争议的问题。是否应该给测试团队一份网络图的副本，列出主机、拓扑、操作系统等？这种晶体盒测试允许测试人员在启动任何扫描之前看到目标内部。或者，测试可能是零知识参与，测试团队只获得一个域名，并期望通过侦察和扫描找出网络拓扑和目标。一些组织之所以选择零知识测试，是因为“它更像现实世界中的黑客在我们的环境中看到的东西”。不幸的是，这不一定是真的。现实世界中的攻击者可能拥有您的网络架构图片、从垃圾箱中被盗、从受骗员工处传真或被临时员工窃取。通过网络图，渗透测试团队可以从目标的角度分析最坏情况。零知识测试的一个更好的理由是，一些组织担心网络图可能会使测试人员产生偏差，从而使他们错过项目。许多网络图有很大的局限性或错误，缺少很多细节，有时会忽略主机或整个网络。最后，由于攻击者可以快速执行侦察和扫描，因此完全知识测试往往更具成本效益。此外，错误对超出范围的系统造成损坏的可能性也会降低。尽管大多数渗透测试人员同时执行零知识和全知识测试，但通常建议使用后一种方法。当然，你可以采取一种混合的方法，测试团队只需要一个域名，然后执行详细的侦察和扫描。大约一周后，目标组织会提供一个详细的图表，用于进一步的测试和分析。在执行这种混合测试时，在报告中明确标记测试人员发现的元素以及目标组织向他们提供的项目。混合测试通常需要更长的时间，因此成本更高。您可以在零知识渗透测试中使用每日电话会议，开始询问更多问题，这可以将项目转换为更全面的知识风格测试

: Here is a crucial issue to emphasize in your Rules of Engagement: If the team successfully penetrates a target, should they avoid viewing data on the target? Think about it: You might have sensitive employee or customer data on the target. A penetration tester has just gotten root on the box and might be able to view all that data. Only your Rules of Engagement prevent that from happening, so make sure they are clear on this topic. For some kinds of information, including healthcare and personal financial data, only duly authorized representatives with a need to know are allowed to see such information, under various regulatory initiatives such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in the United States and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
 We recommend that your default Rules of Engagement allow the testers to view configuration data from a machine but to avoid looking at any customer and user data on the machine. Also, if sniffers are used on the compromised box, make sure the team explicitly documents that any personal data captured from the network will be ignored by the testing team.
 Although the default policy is usually to avoid accessing sensitive user data, in some tests, it may be appropriate to sample small amounts of sensitive user data to confirm access and assess the business impact. Such access should be done sparingly and only with written permission from target system personnel. Also, try to focus more on counting the number of sensitive records you can access (based on file length, number of lines, number of files, number of rows in a database table, or other metric based on the type of data and the form of access you've gained) than on retrieving the sensitive content.; 在你的接战规则中，有一个关键问题需要强调：如果团队成功穿透目标，他们是否应该避免查看目标上的数据？想一想：目标上可能有敏感的员工或客户数据。渗透测试人员刚刚在盒子上找到根，可能能够查看所有数据。只有你的参与规则才能阻止这种情况的发生，所以要确保它们在这个主题上是明确的。对于某些类型的信息，包括医疗保健和个人财务数据，根据各种监管举措，如美国的《健康保险可携带性和责任法案》（HIPAA）和《格拉姆-利奇-布莱利法案》（GLBA）以及欧盟《一般数据保护条例》（GDPR），只有需要知道的正式授权代表才允许查看此类信息。我们建议您的默认参与规则允许测试人员查看来自机器的配置数据，但避免查看机器上的任何客户和用户数据。此外，如果在受损盒子上使用了嗅探器，请确保团队明确记录从网络捕获的任何个人数据将被测试团队忽略。虽然默认策略通常是避免访问敏感用户数据，但在某些测试中，可能适合对少量敏感用户数据进行采样，以确认访问并评估业务影响。此类访问应谨慎进行，并且只有在获得目标系统人员书面许可的情况下才能进行。此外，尽量将重点放在计算可以访问的敏感记录的数量上（基于文件长度、行数、文件数、数据库表中的行数，或基于数据类型和访问形式的其他指标），而不是检索敏感内容

: When an organization engages third-party penetration testers, there is a common set of documents that are signed.
 This may vary somewhat, but these three documents are very common.
 Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)-Also known as a mutual non-disclosure agreement (MNDA). This document limits what each part can share about the test including data the testers may find during the test.
 Master Service Agreement (MSA)-The MSA contains items that are much broader than a single test. For example, an organization will negotiate common payment terms for all outside vendors to make it easier on the organization. This includes critical penetration testing specific pieces such as: •Intellectual Property (IP) Ownership-Who will own the report? If the client owns the report, does that mean the that if the testers reuse general findings they are infringing on a copyright? To resolve this issue, many testers retain ownership of the report and offer a non-revocable license to the report.
 •Another important piece is limitation of liability for damage or disruption. If damage is caused through unforeseeable circumstances, then the testers are not held liable. You should never guarantee 100% uptime, as systems will crash even under the best operating conditions.
 Statement of Work (SOW)-Contains the details specific to the test including the scope, methodology, and types of tests to be performed.
 Finally, never state that you will find all the vulnerabilities. The MSA, SOW, and/or report should include a clause stating that issues may have been missed and that the test is a point in time snapshot. Additionally, make it clear that your service does not guarantee the security of any system, or that computer intrusions will not occur.

: Because establishing firm Rules of Engagement and scoping a project properly are so important, we will now conduct a lab on the topic. In this lab, class attendees will formulate questions and responses associated with a penetration testing Request for Proposal (RFP). The goal of this lab is to help testers get a feel for the kinds of questions and answers that should be asked to scope a project and to determine the Rules of Engagement, sharing information about risks and benefits between clients and testers.; 因为建立明确的参与规则和正确界定项目范围非常重要，我们现在将就此主题开展一个实验室。在本实验室中，课堂参与者将制定与渗透测试提案请求（RFP）相关的问题和回答。本实验室的目标是帮助测试人员了解在确定项目范围和确定参与规则时应询问的各种问题和答案，并在客户和测试人员之间共享有关风险和利益的信息

: The planning and pre-engagement phase usually concludes with the kickoff call in which all the testers (or at least test leads) and the target personnel discuss any final planning and details. The call usually reminds everyone of the scope and rules of engagement as a final discussion of any potential issues.
 During this call (or in a follow-up email), the testers and the target organization will exchange contact information. During a test, the testing team may crash a target; discover an urgent, high-risk vulnerability; or find evidence of a previous intrusion. In such cases, the team may immediately need to contact personnel in the target company to report the issue.
 Sometimes the target company personnel needs to reach the testing team to verify that an observed attack is coming from the testers. What if an evil attacker starts hitting the target at the same time that the penetration testers begin their work? The target organization needs to be able to contact the testing team 24/7 during the duration of the test. Therefore, both sides need to be available around the clock during the test.
 After you identify points of contact, be sure to agree upon a secured method of communication regarding vulnerability details and the final report. The penetration testing team will be handling some sensitive data, which you may need to email to the points of contact among target system personnel. You do not want to send this information in cleartext. Instead, choose a suitable encryption solution. Many times, teams will use encrypted email. Increasingly, teams are moving to security content management technology (such as Box).
 The free, open-source Gnu Privacy Guard or commercial PGP is an acceptable solution here. However, due to the additional technical requirements and the waning usage, this is less often used these days. If you do choose to use PGP/GPG, make sure to exchange public keys and verify their fingerprints. Encrypted ZIP files are an option but are less secure because the shared password used to protect the symmetric key in the ZIP file could come under attack. A bad guy could steal the shared password, or it could leak if it is shared among too many people. For example, sometimes target system personnel may be tempted to send the password for the ZIP file in email, potentially exposing it. The more common issue with ZIP files is that many email servers will not allow attachments of this type.
 Another element that we find useful to define in our Rules of Engagement is to require a daily debriefing conference call. At the beginning or end of each testing day, schedule a brief session between the testing team and; 规划和预参与阶段通常以启动呼叫结束，在启动呼叫中，所有测试人员（或至少测试负责人）和目标人员讨论任何最终规划和细节。通话通常会提醒大家参与的范围和规则，作为对任何潜在问题的最终讨论。在通话期间（或在后续电子邮件中），测试人员和目标组织将交换联系信息。在测试过程中，测试团队可能会撞击目标；发现紧急的高风险漏洞；或者找到之前入侵的证据。在这种情况下，团队可能需要立即联系目标公司的人员报告问题。有时，目标公司人员需要联系测试团队，以验证观察到的攻击是否来自测试人员。如果一个邪恶的攻击者在渗透测试人员开始工作的同时开始攻击目标，该怎么办？目标组织需要能够在测试期间全天候联系测试团队。因此，测试期间双方都需要24小时可用。确定接触点后，请确保就漏洞详细信息和最终报告商定一种安全的通信方法。渗透测试团队将处理一些敏感数据，您可能需要通过电子邮件将这些数据发送给目标系统人员之间的联系人。您不希望以明文形式发送此信息。相反，请选择合适的加密解决方案。很多时候，团队会使用加密的电子邮件。团队越来越多地转向安全内容管理技术（如Box）。免费、开源的Gnu Privacy Guard或商业PGP是这里可以接受的解决方案。然而，由于附加的技术要求和日益减少的使用，这是不经常使用这些天。如果您确实选择使用PGP/GPG，请确保交换公钥并验证其指纹。加密的ZIP文件是一种选择，但安全性较低，因为用于保护ZIP文件中对称密钥的共享密码可能会受到攻击。坏人可能会窃取共享的密码，或者如果共享的人太多，密码可能会泄漏。例如，有时目标系统人员可能会试图在电子邮件中发送ZIP文件的密码，这可能会暴露它。ZIP文件更常见的问题是，许多电子邮件服务器不允许使用这种类型的附件。我们发现在参与规则中定义另一个有用的元素是需要每天召开电话会议听取情况汇报。在每个测试日的开始或结束时，安排测试团队和

: one or two representatives of the target organization. These calls help to make sure that everyone understands the progress of the test and to identify any issues early on.
 During the debriefing, the team should discuss what the team has done so far and what they plan to do next. In addition, any major findings can be reviewed. Finally, the target organization can confirm whether its detection mechanisms (IDS, IPS, log review, and so on) have been triggered by the test.
 If a daily call is too onerous given the busy schedules of target environment personnel, consider conducting a debriefing call twice per week during the duration of the test.; 目标组织的一名或两名代表。这些电话有助于确保每个人都了解测试的进度，并在早期识别任何问题。在听取情况汇报期间，团队应讨论到目前为止团队已经做了什么以及他们下一步计划做什么。此外，可以审查任何重大发现。最后，目标组织可以确认其检测机制（ID、IP、日志审查等）是否已由测试触发。如果由于目标环境人员的繁忙日程安排，日常通话过于繁重，请考虑在测试期间每周进行两次汇报通话

: The next portion of the course deals with the first phase of the test: Reconnaissance. During this phase, the tester leams as much as possible about the target organization. One important aspect of this recon phase is building an inventory of potential target machines that are likely associated with the target organization. This inventory must be vetted carefully to ensure that it is indeed in scope before any scanning activities (the next phase of the process after reconnaissance) can begin.
 When planning a test, we recommend that you budget and schedule at least 8 to 10 hours of detailed reconnaissance work or more if resources allow. Don't skip recon. It can provide crucial insights for the remainder of the entire test.; 本课程的下一部分涉及测试的第一阶段：侦察。在此阶段，测试人员尽可能多地了解目标组织。该侦察阶段的一个重要方面是建立可能与目标组织相关的潜在目标机器的库存。在开始任何扫描活动（侦察后的下一阶段）之前，必须仔细审查该清单，以确保其确实在范围内。在计划测试时，我们建议您预算和安排至少8到10小时的详细侦察工作，如果资源允许，可以安排更多。不要跳过侦察。它可以为整个测试的其余部分提供至关重要的见解

: The goal of the reconnaissance phase is to gather useful information about the target that will aid in our attacks.
 We are going to scout the target, but not let them know we are doing so. We are going to search through publicly available data to help in our testing.
 Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a subset of reconnaissance. OSINT is defined as: is a method of using open source tools to collect information from publicly available sources and then analyze it in order to make a decision or take some action.

: We use the data found during the recon phase to help use make better targeting and attack decisions. If we are going to do phishing, we need to research the users in the organization so we can develop a phish that is likely to be opened. Recon helps us decide on the user and select a ruse that will increase our likelihood of success.
 Another common recon goal is to discover the format for usernames. This will aid in developing a list for widescale phishing attacks, since the first portion of the email address is often the same as the username. Knowledge of the format also means password attacks are more effective. Using the wrong username format could mean that all the password guessing attacks are wasted effort Knowledge of the internal infrastructure can help us save time by informing testers of the systems and software (and ports) to look for. For example, if you know the organization uses Microsoft SQL Server, you can save time (and keep a lower profile) by only looking for TCP/1433 instead of this and all the other common database ports.; 我们使用侦察阶段发现的数据帮助用户做出更好的目标定位和攻击决策。如果我们要做网络钓鱼，我们需要研究组织中的用户，这样我们就可以开发一个可能被打开的网络钓鱼。侦察帮助我们决定用户，并选择一个可以增加我们成功可能性的策略。另一个常见的侦察目标是发现用户名的格式。这将有助于开发大规模网络钓鱼攻击列表，因为电子邮件地址的第一部分通常与用户名相同。了解该格式也意味着密码攻击更有效。使用错误的用户名格式可能意味着所有密码猜测攻击都是徒劳的。了解内部基础设施可以通过通知测试人员要查找的系统和软件（以及端口）来帮助我们节省时间。例如，如果您知道该组织使用Microsoft SQL Server，您可以通过只查找TCP/1433而不是此端口和所有其他通用数据库端口来节省时间（并保持较低的配置文件）

: When it comes to the data we are after, it can be grouped into three categories: organization, infrastructure, and employee data.
 Organizational information is not going to to be technical details, but it can still be very helpful. This information is tremendously useful for phishing attacks as it allows us to develop relevant emails in hopes of getting users to open the email. It can also be useful for targeting and goal setting. For example, if the organization has a press release on a new development or technological breakthrough, we can use that as a phishing pretext; and, once inside, we can target our pillaging and pivoting towards the sensitive data.
 Information on the target infrastructure helps us target the right software through client-side attacks as well as network-based attacks. If we can learn the AV/EDR in use, we can tailor our payloads and actions to avoid detection. We may even learn about network topology and architecture, which is very useful when pivoting inside the organization. This information is also valuable for social engineering (phone and email), if you are impersonating IT or pretending to be a user calling the help desk.
 User information is the often the most directly useful information. If we, the testers, are lucky (and the target isn't) then we may be able to find breached credentials for users at the target organization and immediately login. If if the credentials don't immediately work, we know the types of passwords used by people in the organization. We can also learn about the hierarchy and organizational structure which can help with phishing or social engineering as well as "admin hunting".; 当谈到我们需要的数据时，它可以分为三类：组织、基础设施和员工数据。组织信息不会成为技术细节，但它仍然非常有用。这些信息对网络钓鱼攻击非常有用，因为它允许我们开发相关电子邮件，希望让用户打开电子邮件。它还可以用于确定目标和设定目标。例如，如果组织发布了关于新开发或技术突破的新闻稿，我们可以将其作为钓鱼的借口；而且，一旦进入，我们可以针对我们的掠夺和转向敏感数据。有关目标基础设施的信息有助于我们通过客户端攻击和基于网络的攻击瞄准正确的软件。如果我们可以学习使用中的AV/EDR，我们可以定制有效负载和操作以避免检测。我们甚至可以了解网络拓扑和架构，这在组织内部旋转时非常有用。如果您正在模拟这些信息或假装是呼叫服务台的用户，则这些信息对于社会工程（电话和电子邮件）也很有价值。用户信息通常是最直接有用的信息。如果我们，测试人员，幸运（而目标不是），那么我们可能能够为目标组织的用户找到被破坏的凭据，并立即登录。如果凭据不能立即工作，我们就知道组织中人员使用的密码类型。我们还可以了解有助于钓鱼或社会工程以及“管理员搜索”的层次结构和组织结构

: Nearly every modem organization has a website with publicly available content that is intentionally shared with customers and clients. The website and the linked pages are intended to be shared with the world. On the website is often information about upcoming projects and promotions. Depending on the size of the company, they may publish annual reports and press releases that offer insight into various aspects of the company. Some organizations have a jobs/careers portion of their site that describes the job and candidate requirements, which may include details about the organization's hierarchy, people, and technology.
 Not all publicly available information is intentionally shared. It could be that a sensitive document is accidentally posted on the website. In addition, users will sometimes discuss sensitive information about their company on social media or public fomms. Data may even be dumped online as part of a breach.
 Servers will often announce the software they are running. For example, web servers will, by default, include the "Server” header that describes the server version. Web servers may send other headers to the client but reveal information about the servers as shown below: Server: Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.29 The above headers are not useful to the client (browser). Other protocols will reveal similar data about the server that is not useful to the client.

: Ideally, we should dedicate some time for reconnaissance during our testing. If the target pushes back on spending time performing reconnaissance, we could cut back the recon portion of the test or borrow time from the rest of the test. While performing good OSINT is a valuable skill to develop, you can often get good results from junior testers and interns. In a compliance-based test (i.e., internal PCI) you could skip the recon phase, but for tests that include social engineering, this phase is a must. If the engagement is a full Red Team, even more recon time is necessary.; 理想情况下，我们应该在测试期间投入一些时间进行侦察。如果目标推迟执行侦察的时间，我们可以减少测试的侦察部分或借用测试其余部分的时间。虽然执行良好的OSIT是一项需要开发的宝贵技能，但您通常可以从初级测试人员和实习生那里获得良好的结果。在基于遵从性的测试（即内部PCI）中，您可以跳过重新确认阶段，但对于包括社会工程学的测试，此阶段是必须的。如果交战是一个完整的红色团队，则需要更多的侦察时间

: In the reconnaissance phase, you are sending little to no traffic to the target network. Ideally, it is zero-touch, meaning no data is sent from your systems to the target. In this case, all data is gathered from third parties or third parties are used to access the targets. Only rarely can we get all the information we need without interacting with the target or will be prohibited from accessing the target as a normal user.
 If you interact with the target systems directly, make sure you do so in a way that looks like normal traffic (no scanning, no attacking). If you browse the target website just as a normal user would, then it will be impossible to detect and your testing systems will not be detected. This is especially important in Red Team engagements where stealth is paramount. If you need stealth, we recommend using dedicated recon systems/IP addresses that are not used for other portions of the assessment.; 在侦察阶段，您向目标网络发送的流量很少甚至没有。理想情况下，它是零接触的，这意味着没有数据从您的系统发送到目标。在这种情况下，从第三方收集所有数据，或使用第三方访问目标。只有极少数情况下，我们才能在不与目标交互的情况下获得所需的所有信息，或者被禁止作为普通用户访问目标。如果您直接与目标系统交互，请确保以类似于正常流量的方式进行交互（无扫描，无攻击）。如果你像普通用户一样浏览目标网站，那么就不可能检测到，你的测试系统也不会被检测到。这一点在红队作战中尤为重要，因为在红队中，隐身至关重要。如果您需要隐身，我们建议使用专用侦察系统/IP地址，这些地址不用于评估的其他部分; Penetration testers aim to mimic and model real-world adversaries, but there are limits. We should always be respectful even though we are attempting to trick users. This can be an ethical, moral, and/or spiritual dilemma, and some penetration testers will not take part in such activities, even while others pen testers see no such issue.
 We do not intend to resolve the conflicts here, but we do want to address that these debates do exist.
 The evil attackers are already breaking the law and may use tactics and techniques that are ethically, morally, and legally off limits. We need to act better than the evil attackers and operate within a safe environment. Our end goal is to help the organization determine its weaknesses. The organization and its people should should be better off after working with us.
 We should not put undue stress on the targets of phishing or social engineering tests. As such, pretexts that can cause extreme emotion should be avoided. Example bad pretexts include using someone being injured in a car accident, anything involving children, or direct threats against someone's job. We highly recommend reading the Social Engineering Code of Ethics before you do any social engineering or phishing: https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/general-discussion/code-of-ethics/ Shortlink:redsiege.com/560/se-ethics; 渗透测试旨在模拟和模拟现实世界中的对手，但也有局限性。即使我们试图欺骗用户，我们也应该始终保持尊重。这可能是一个道德、道德和/或精神困境，一些渗透测试人员不会参加此类活动，即使其他笔试人员没有看到此类问题。我们不打算解决这里的冲突，但我们确实想解决这些辩论确实存在的问题。邪恶的袭击者已经触犯了法律，他们可能会使用道德、道德和法律上禁止使用的战术和技术。我们需要比邪恶的袭击者做得更好，在安全的环境中行动。我们的最终目标是帮助组织确定其弱点。与我们合作后，本组织及其人员的境况应该会更好。我们不应该过分强调网络钓鱼或社会工程测试的目标。因此，应该避免可能导致极端情绪的借口。例如，不好的借口包括利用在车祸中受伤的人、涉及儿童的任何事情或直接威胁某人的工作。我们强烈建议您在进行任何社会工程或网络钓鱼之前阅读社会工程道德规范：https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/general-discussion/code-of-ethics/短链接：RedSize.com/560/se-ethics

: At this point, we need to find out information about the target that can give us a better understanding of their goals, processes, and initiatives, which, in turn, helps us better understand the business risks. Armed with this knowledge, we can write a more effective executive summary by more accurately describing the risk and impact in their terms. This context also allows us to write findings that more accurately describe the potential organizational risk and impact.
 This is also the beginning of the fun! It is time to start thinking like a bad guy! We can look at this information to help us better target the organization from a social engineering or phishing perspective. When you start looking at this information, start thinking of ways an evil attacker would or could use it against them.; 在这一点上，我们需要找到有关目标的信息，这些信息可以让我们更好地了解他们的目标、流程和计划，进而帮助我们更好地理解业务风险。有了这些知识，我们可以通过更准确地描述风险和影响来编写更有效的执行摘要。这一背景还允许我们撰写更准确地描述潜在组织风险和影响的调查结果。这也是乐趣的开始！是时候开始像坏人一样思考了！我们可以查看这些信息，以帮助我们从社会工程或网络钓鱼的角度更好地定位组织。当你开始查看这些信息时，开始思考一个邪恶的攻击者会或可能会对他们使用这些信息的方式

: A simple starting point is Wikipedia (assuming the organization is large enough). This can give you some basic information on the organization as well as a history that may not be on the target's website. You may find domains, but this list is likely to be quite limited. You may find sub-companies or affiliations that could lead you to other domains. These affiliations may also be easy sources for phishing or social-engineering pretexts.
 Maybe the company purchased or merged with another organization. It could be that domains associated with the old company are available for purchase and are still trusted by mail servers or other systems.; 一个简单的起点是维基百科（假设组织足够大）。这可以为您提供有关该组织的一些基本信息以及可能不在目标网站上的历史记录。你可以找到域名，但这个列表可能非常有限。你可能会发现子公司或附属机构，可以引导你到其他领域。这些联系也可能是网络钓鱼或社会工程借口的容易来源。可能该公司收购或与其他组织合并。可能是与旧公司相关的域可以购买，并且仍然受到邮件服务器或其他系统的信任

: Most organizations have job requisition information available on the internet as they look to hire new staff. These job requests often contain detailed information about the technical environment of the enterprise. For example, if the target organization is looking for IIS administrators, we now know something about the web servers it uses. If it seeks skilled Checkpoint firewall admins, we have information about at least some of its firewalls. If it is looking for developers with Cold Fusion experience, we now know a little more about some of its web applications. What's more, if the job req is still active, we know that the target organization does not have enough experienced staff members to handle that part of its infrastructure. After all, if it did have the expertise already inhouse—why would it be seeking to hire people with those skills? To search for job requisitions, you could use Google with the "site:" directive focused on the target's domain, followed by common terms used on pages for hiring. We recommend searches like the following: gdfcgt:[companydomain] careers site:[companydomain] jobs site§[companydomain] openings You can narrow down your results further by inserting terms such as Information Technology, internet, ecommerce, firewall, and so forth.
 In addition, a thorough tester should look for job reqs on various job-hunting sites, such as Monster.com. On Monster.com, the Information Technology, Intemet/E-commerce, and Telecomm categories are helpful. You can even narrow down your searches based on geographic areas.; 大多数组织在招聘新员工时，都会在互联网上提供工作申请信息。这些工作请求通常包含有关企业技术环境的详细信息。例如，如果目标组织正在寻找IIS管理员，那么我们现在了解了它使用的web服务器的一些信息。如果它寻求熟练的检查点防火墙管理员，我们至少有一些防火墙的信息。如果它正在寻找具有冷融合经验的开发人员，那么我们现在对它的一些web应用程序有了更多的了解。此外，如果职位需求仍然活跃，我们知道目标组织没有足够的经验丰富的员工来处理其基础设施的这一部分。毕竟，如果它确实已经拥有内部的专业知识，为什么它会寻求雇用具备这些技能的人呢？要搜索求职申请，你可以使用谷歌的“网站：”指令，重点放在目标的领域，然后是招聘页面上使用的常用术语。我们建议您进行以下搜索：gdfcgt:[companydomain]职业网站：[companydomain]工作网站§[companydomain]openings您可以通过插入信息技术、互联网、电子商务、防火墙等术语来进一步缩小搜索范围。此外，一个全面的测试人员应该在各种求职网站上寻找工作需求，例如Monster.com。在怪物身上。com、信息技术、互联网/电子商务和电信类别都很有帮助。你甚至可以根据地理区域缩小搜索范围

: As a start of the recon phase, the tester can use a search engine, such as Google, to learn more about the target organization. In particular, we recommend conducting searches on the target organization's name to gather the following information, which should be recorded in the tester's results: •Major businesses: What is the industry or industries associated with the target? Financial services? Government agency? Manufacturing? •Major products or services: What does the target organization produce? What are the brand names of its products or services? •Corporate officers and other VIPs: Who is most important in the target organization? Who are its leaders? Who is associated with its technical infrastructure? •Major competitors: Who competes with the target organization? What is the target organization's relative performance vis-a-vis its competitors? Is it the market leader? •Physical locations: Where are the major facilities of the target organization? •Recent press releases: What has the target enterprise told the public lately about itself? What does it consider important from an image and marketing perspective?; 作为侦察阶段的开始，测试人员可以使用搜索引擎（如谷歌）来了解更多有关目标组织的信息。特别是，我们建议对目标组织的名称进行搜索，以收集以下信息，这些信息应记录在测试人员的结果中：•主要业务：与目标相关的一个或多个行业是什么？金融服务？政府机构？制造业主要产品或服务：目标组织生产什么？其产品或服务的品牌名称是什么公司高管和其他重要人物：目标组织中谁最重要？它的领导人是谁？谁与其技术基础设施相关主要竞争对手：谁与目标组织竞争？目标组织相对于其竞争对手的相对绩效是什么？它是市场领导者吗物理位置：目标组织的主要设施在哪里最近的新闻稿：目标企业最近向公众介绍了自己什么？从形象和营销角度来看，它认为什么是重要的

: The last elements of the Whois record include the Domain Name System (DNS) servers associated with the target organization, listed in the order of primary, secondary, and tertiary (if it exists) DNS servers. We will next try to harvest records from those name servers.
 Name servers are focused on resolving domain names into IP addresses, but that isn't their sole function. They also indicate which machines are mail servers for a given domain, among other useful information. DNS servers house a variety of different records, including: •NS: Nameserver record, which indicates the name servers associated with a given domain.
 •A: Address record, which maps a domain name into an IPv4 address.
 •AAAA: "Quad-A" record, which maps a domain name into an IPv6 address.
 •HINFO: Host Information record, which associates an arbitrary set of information with a domain name, formerly used to indicate system types.
 •MX: Mail Exchange record, which identifies the mail servers for the given domain.
 •TXT: Text record, which includes an arbitrary text string for the domain.
 •CNAME: Canonical Name record, which indicates aliases and alternative names for a given host.
 •SOA: Start of Authority record, which indicates that a server is authoritative for that DNS zone (set of records).
 •RP: Responsible Person records, which are informational, not functional (that is, they have no impact on DNS functionality) and indicate the human responsible for a given domain (seldom used).
 •PTR: Pointer for inverse lookups records, also called reverse records, indicating an IP address to domain name mapping.
 •SRV: Service location records, which provide information about available services, including the port and hostname (seldom used).; Whois记录的最后一个元素包括与目标组织关联的域名系统（DNS）服务器，按主要、次要和第三级（如果存在）DNS服务器的顺序列出。接下来，我们将尝试从这些名称服务器中获取记录。名称服务器专注于将域名解析为IP地址，但这并非其唯一功能。除其他有用信息外，它们还指示哪些机器是给定域的邮件服务器。DNS服务器包含各种不同的记录，包括：•NS：名称服务器记录，表示与给定域关联的名称服务器A： 地址记录，将域名映射到IPv4地址AAAA：“Quad-A”记录，将域名映射到IPv6地址HINFO：主机信息记录，将任意一组信息与域名相关联，以前用于表示系统类型MX：邮件交换记录，用于标识给定域的邮件服务器TXT：文本记录，包括域的任意文本字符串CNAME：规范名称记录，表示给定主机的别名和替代名称SOA：权限记录的开始，表示服务器对该DNS区域（记录集）具有权限RP：负责人记录，具有信息性，不具有功能性（即，它们对DNS功能没有影响），并指示负责给定域的人员（很少使用）PTR：反向查找记录的指针，也称为反向记录，表示IP地址到域名的映射SRV：服务位置记录，提供有关可用服务的信息，包括端口和主机名（很少使用）
